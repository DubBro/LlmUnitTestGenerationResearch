    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (OntologyHelperTests), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent very clear.",
    "AAA structure is explicitly used and visually separated with // Arrange // Act // Assert comments and blank lines, aiding quick scanning.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for input variations is appropriate and avoids unnecessary duplication for parameterized cases.",
    "Naming of local variables (node, expected, actual, input) is clear and consistent with standard C# conventions.",
    "Tests are short, focused, and avoid nested classes or unnecessary complexity, which improves readability.",
    "No extraneous comments or noise in the code; only structural comments for AAA are present.",
    "Some repeated Arrange boilerplate for creating and configuring INode mocks could be factored into helpers to slightly improve maintainability, but it does not significantly harm readability."
