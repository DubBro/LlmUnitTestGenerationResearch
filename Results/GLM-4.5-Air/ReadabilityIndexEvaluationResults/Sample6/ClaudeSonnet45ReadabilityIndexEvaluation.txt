	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class uses nested classes to organize tests by method, which deviates from the recommended flat structure and adds unnecessary complexity",
		"Test method names follow a variant of the recommended pattern using 'Given/When' BDD style instead of 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult', but remain clear and descriptive",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied with proper comment markers and logical separation across all tests",
		"Naming conventions are clear and meaningful for variables, fields, and methods throughout the codebase",
		"Multiple similar validation tests in AddLot and UpdateLot could be consolidated using [Theory] and [InlineData] to reduce duplication",
		"Proper use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios demonstrates understanding of xUnit conventions",
		"Dependencies are properly mocked using NSubstitute with clear setup in the constructor",
		"Assert blocks are concise and focused, making expected outcomes immediately clear",
		"No extraneous comments beyond AAA markers, keeping the code clean and maintainable",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout all test methods enhances overall readability"
