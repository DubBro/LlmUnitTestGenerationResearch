  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LotServiceTests` clearly matches the SUT and follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention.",
    "Test methods are consistently named in a descriptive BDD-like style (e.g., `GivenNullLot_ThrowsInvalidLotException`), making intent clear even if they don’t strictly follow `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult`.",
    "Tests are short, focused, and consistently follow the AAA pattern, with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, and `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) clearly separating logical sections.",
    "Field and variable names (`_unitOfWorkSubstitute`, `_mapperSubstitute`, `lotDto`, `id`) are meaningful and make the role of each object immediately obvious.",
    "Formatting and layout (spacing, braces, line breaks) are consistent, resulting in visually scannable and easy-to-follow test bodies.",
    "Nested classes (`AddLot`, `DeleteLot`, etc.) group scenarios logically by method, improving conceptual organization, but they slightly reduce discoverability and go against the recommendation to avoid unnecessary nesting.",
    "The inheritance pattern (nested classes inheriting from `LotServiceTests` for shared setup) is clear but may be a bit less straightforward for newcomers compared to a single flat test class with shared setup.",
    "Multiple similar negative-validation tests (e.g., various `GivenLotWithNull...` cases) are explicit and readable, but could be parameterized with `[Theory]` to reduce repetition and improve maintainability.",
    "There are no extraneous comments beyond AAA markers, reducing noise and keeping focus on test intent.",
    "Use of the mocking framework (NSubstitute) is straightforward and consistent, with clear expectations and verifications that are easy to understand."
