		"Excellent organization using nested classes per method (e.g., AddLot, UpdateLot), grouping related tests logically.",
		"Test method names follow clear Given/When/Expected patterns, making scenarios easy to understand.",
		"Consistent AAA structure with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and proper separation.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable and field names reflecting purpose (e.g., _unitOfWorkSubstitute, lotDto).",
		"Adheres to C# conventions, uses [Fact] appropriately, no extraneous comments.",
		"Shared setup via inheritance in nested classes is efficient and functional.",
		"High code duplication in similar validation tests (e.g., null checks in AddLot/UpdateLot) reduces maintainability; [Theory]/[InlineData] would help.",
		"Some tests combine Act & Assert with Assert.Throws, which is concise but slightly deviates from full AAA separation.",
		"Minor variable naming inconsistencies (e.g., 'lot' vs 'lotDto').",
		"Unnecessary AsReadOnly() on mock lists adds minor clutter."
