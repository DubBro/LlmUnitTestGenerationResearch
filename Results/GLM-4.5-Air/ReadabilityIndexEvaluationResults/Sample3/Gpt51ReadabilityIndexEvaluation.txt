  "readabilityIndex": 78,
  "reasons": [
    "Base test class name NoteServiceTests clearly reflects the class under test and centralizes common setup, improving clarity and reducing duplication.",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow a clear Given_Scenario_WhenCalled_ExpectedResult style, making intent easy to understand.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently used with Arrange / Act / Assert (or Act & Assert) comments, giving a predictable structure to each test.",
    "Async tests correctly use async Task signatures, and the flow of each test is generally straightforward to follow.",
    "Nested test classes (GetAllByUserIdAsync, GetByIdAsync, etc.) provide grouping by method but introduce an extra level of indirection and do not follow the ClassUnderTestTests naming pattern, slightly harming navigability.",
    "Some assertions and mock verifications are unnecessarily complex (e.g., using e.Compile().Invoke(...) in Arg.Is for GetAllAsync), which reduces readability and makes intent less obvious.",
    "There is noticeable repetition in transaction-related setup and verification across AddAsync, UpdateAsync, and DeleteByIdAsync tests; helpers or shared methods could simplify and improve maintainability.",
    "Property-by-property equality checks are verbose and repeated; while explicit, they could be encapsulated in helper methods to reduce noise and focus tests on behavior rather than data plumbing.",
    "One test contains a confusing and unused variable with a mismatched name and type (noteEntity declared as NoteModel in AddAsync.WhenSaveFails_RollsBackTransaction), which can mislead readers and suggests lack of cleanup."
