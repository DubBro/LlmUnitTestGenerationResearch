	"reasons": [
		"Uses nested classes for grouping tests by method, which organizes code but violates recommendation against unnecessary nested classes",
		"Test method names are descriptive using Given/When style but deviate slightly from strict MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Consistently follows AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and empty line separation",
		"Clear, meaningful naming for classes, methods, variables, and mocks",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] and [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication",
		"Async tests correctly use async Task signatures",
		"Verbose repetitive assertions in some tests reduce conciseness",
		"Complex NSubstitute argument matchers (e.g., Arg.Is with Compile().Invoke) slightly hinder readability",
		"Some tests combine // Act & Assert, blurring AAA separation",
		"Shared mock setup in base constructor promotes maintainability"
