	"reasons": [
		"Test class uses nested public classes for grouping tests by method under test, which deviates from the standard flat structure but can improve organization.",
		"Test names follow the Given/When/Then pattern (e.g., GivenValidUserId_WhenCalled_ReturnsNoteModels) instead of the recommended MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, but are still clear and descriptive.",
		"AAA pattern is consistently followed with clear Arrange, Act, Assert blocks separated by comments and empty lines.",
		"Proper use of async Task signature for asynchronous tests.",
		"Good use of Theory with InlineData for parameterized tests.",
		"Some test method names are misleading: GivenNoteModelWithNullContent_WhenCalled_ThrowsNoteNotFoundException suggests NoteNotFoundException but likely intends a validation exception.",
		"Assertions are verbose and repetitive in places (e.g., multiple Assert.Equal for each property), which reduces readability.",
		"Complex mock setup with Expression predicates makes some tests harder to read at a glance.",
		"Overall structure is logical and maintainable despite minor deviations from ideal naming conventions."
