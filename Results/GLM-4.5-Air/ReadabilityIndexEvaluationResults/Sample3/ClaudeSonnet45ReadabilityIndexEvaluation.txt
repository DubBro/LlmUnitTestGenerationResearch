	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'NoteServiceTests', clearly indicating the class under test",
		"Nested classes are used to group tests by method, which aids organization but deviates from the flat structure recommendation",
		"Test method names follow 'GivenX_WhenY_ReturnsZ' pattern which is clear and descriptive, though differs slightly from the recommended 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"AAA pattern is consistently followed with clear comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and proper spacing",
		"No extraneous comments beyond AAA block separators, keeping tests clean and focused",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple input variations",
		"Constructor setup centralizes mock initialization, promoting DRY principles and test maintainability",
		"Consistent naming conventions for variables (camelCase for locals, underscore prefix for fields) following C# standards",
		"Some assertion blocks are verbose with repetitive checks that could be simplified for better readability"
