		"Nested test classes violate specified pattern and add unnecessary inheritance complexity",
		"Test names use BDD style instead of required MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult format",
		"Complex lambda with Compile().Invoke() in Received assertion is difficult to comprehend",
		"Multiple repetitive Assert.Equal calls for property verification are overly verbose",
		"Exception tests combine Act and Assert blocks, deviating from pure AAA pattern",

		"Base class constructor setup obscures per-test dependencies",
		"Theory test names don't include method name, reducing test identification clarity"
