  "readabilityIndex": 94,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (`StringExtensionsTests`), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making each test’s intent explicit.",
    "AAA structure is clearly present and visually separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, improving scanability.",
    "Use of `[Fact]` for single scenarios and `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple input variations is appropriate and consistent.",
    "Assertions are simple and direct (`Assert.True`, `Assert.False`, `Assert.Equal`, `Assert.Null`), making outcomes easy to understand.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments; the file is structurally flat and easy to navigate.",
    "Variable naming is clear (`c`, `s`, `input`, `expected`, `result`) and appropriate for the small scopes within each test.",
    "Tests are short, focused, and follow a consistent style across different methods, improving maintainability.",
    "Related scenarios (e.g., `IsInteger`, `IsNumber`, `Reverse`, `ToCsvCompatible`, `GetFileExtension`) are logically grouped, aiding discoverability.",
    "Minor potential improvement: some very similar tests (e.g., several `ToCsvCompatible` and `GetFileExtension` cases) could be consolidated into theories to reduce repetition, but this does not significantly harm readability."
