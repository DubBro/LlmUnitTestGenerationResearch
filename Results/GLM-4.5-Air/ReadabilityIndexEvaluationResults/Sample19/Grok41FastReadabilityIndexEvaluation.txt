		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names consistently follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication.",
	 "Strict adherence to AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments throughout.",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names and standard C# conventions.",
		"Minor issue: In [Theory] tests, empty // Arrange blocks are not always separated by empty lines from // Act.",
		"High repetition in simple test bodies is inherent but well-structured and readable."
