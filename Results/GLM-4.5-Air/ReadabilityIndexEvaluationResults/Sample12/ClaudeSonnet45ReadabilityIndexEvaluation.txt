	"readabilityIndex": 78,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the standard pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, making test purpose clear",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied across all tests with clear comment separators and proper spacing",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] and [Theory] attributes - theories are used to avoid duplication for similar test scenarios",
		"Variable names are clear and descriptive (e.g., 'nonSquareMatrix', 'singularMatrix', 'emptyPermutation')",
		"Tests contain excessive inline comments explaining matrix properties (e.g., '// Expected L for this permutation') that could be removed since test names and assertions are self-explanatory",
		"Some tests have very long assertion blocks that could benefit from helper methods or more concise verification approaches",
		"The 'GetMatrix_PassingSquareMatrix_ReturnsCorrectStringRepresentation' test has redundant parameters in [InlineData] (size and n are always equal)",
		"Overall structure is logical and maintainable with consistent formatting throughout"
	]
