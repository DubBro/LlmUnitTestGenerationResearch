		"Presence of comments beyond Arrange/Act/Assert blocks in multiple tests violates the ideal readability standard",
		"Unused parameter 'size' in Theory test 'GetMatrix_PassingSquareMatrix_ReturnsCorrectStringRepresentation' creates confusion",
		"Redundant 'n' parameter in Theory test 'GetPermutationMatrix_PassingValidPermutation_ReturnsCorrectStringRepresentation' could be derived from array length",
		"Test names excellently follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern throughout",
		"Test class name 'LUPDecompositionTests' correctly follows ClassUnderTestTests convention",
		"Arrange/Act/Assert blocks are clearly separated and well-structured in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple inputs",
		"Variable names are clear, meaningful, and consistently reflect their purpose",
		"Modern C# syntax (out discard) is used appropriately, improving conciseness"
