		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names consistently follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for variations.",
		"Clear AAA structure with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments in most tests.",
		"Meaningful variable names reflecting purpose, e.g., nonSquareMatrix, singularMatrix.",
		"Adheres to C# naming conventions and standard formatting.",
		"Minor deviation: Some tests combine // Act & Assert for exceptions.",
		"Extra explanatory comments beyond AAA markers, e.g., '// Verify L is unit lower triangular'.",
		"Verbose individual Assert.Equal calls for matrix verification, but logically clear.",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or code duplication."
