	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the correct pattern (LUPDecompositionTests).",
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern (e.g., Decompose_PassingNonSquareMatrix_ThrowsArgumentException).",
		"AAA pattern is consistently used with clear Arrange, Act, Assert blocks marked with comments.",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests to avoid code duplication.",
		"Variables and parameters are meaningfully named (e.g., singularMatrix, nonSquareMatrix).",
		"Tests are logically structured and separated by empty lines, enhancing readability.",
		"No unnecessary nested classes, and test methods are well-organized within a single class.",
		"Asserts are clear and focused, with specific checks for matrix dimensions and values.",
		"Minor issue: Some test methods have large assertion blocks which could be broken into helper methods for better maintainability.",
		"Some tests mix multiple assertions for L, U, and P dimensions and values, but overall structure remains readable."
