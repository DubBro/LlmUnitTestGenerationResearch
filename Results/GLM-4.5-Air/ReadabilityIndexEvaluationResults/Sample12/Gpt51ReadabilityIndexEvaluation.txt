  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LUPDecompositionTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and indicates scope.",
    "Individual test method names consistently follow the `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are highly descriptive.",
    "AAA pattern is followed in all tests with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) separators, making flow easy to follow.",
    "Formatting, indentation, and use of xUnit attributes (`[Fact]` for single cases, `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for parameterized scenarios) are correct and consistent.",
    "Exception tests are concise and readable, directly expressing intent with `Assert.Throws` and meaningful messages.",
    "Matrix and permutation verification is explicit and systematic, making expectations clear despite the volume of assertions.",
    "There are minor deviations from C# naming conventions (e.g., parameter `int[] P`, redundant `size` parameter in theory) which slightly reduce clarity.",
    "Additional explanatory comments inside Assert sections (e.g., `// Expected L ...`, `// Verify L is unit lower triangular`) go beyond the ideal of only AAA comments; they help understanding but also add small noise and inconsistency with the stated ideal."
