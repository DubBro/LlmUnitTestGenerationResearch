		"Test class naming follows the correct pattern (LuTests, DecomposeTests, EliminateTests), but nested classes for test groups are acceptable but can be replaced with separate classes.",
		"Test method names follow the clear pattern 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult'.",
		"AAA pattern is consistently followed with clear comments for each block.",
		"Theory tests effectively reuse code with InlineData, reducing duplication.",
		"Private helper methods (CreateSquareMatrix) improve maintainability but are duplicated across nested classes.",
		"All tests are synchronous and use appropriate xUnit attributes [Fact] and [Theory].",
		"Assertions are clear and descriptive, including message checks for exceptions.",
		"Nested classes may slightly reduce readability by adding an extra level of indirection; separate top-level classes could be clearer.",
		"Duplicated helper method could be extracted to a shared base or utility class.",
		"Overall structure is logical, making tests easy to follow and maintain."
