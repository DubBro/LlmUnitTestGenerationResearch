  "reasons": [
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and clearly describe intent.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently applied and explicitly separated with comments, making the test flow easy to follow.",
    "Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized cases reduces duplication and aids readability.",
    "Class and method naming is generally meaningful (LuTests, Decompose_SquareMatrix_ReturnsLUMatrices, etc.) and aligns with C# conventions.",
    "Helper method CreateSquareMatrix improves readability of Arrange blocks by hiding low-level array initialization details.",
    "Code formatting (indentation, spacing, braces) is clean and consistent, aiding quick visual parsing.",
    "Nested test classes (DecomposeTests, EliminateTests inside LuTests) add a level of structure but slightly complicate the test hierarchy and are not strictly necessary.",
    "Duplicate implementations of CreateSquareMatrix in both nested classes slightly hurt maintainability and could be centralized.",
    "Assertions are straightforward and focused, though some repeated dimension checks could be encapsulated in small helper methods for better reuse.",
    "Hard-coded array data in [InlineData] is readable but becomes slightly noisy; using named data (MemberData/ClassData) could improve clarity for more complex scenarios."
