	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the correct naming pattern 'LuTests', clearly indicating the class under test",
		"Test methods follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' naming convention consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with clear comments (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and logical separation",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for parameterized tests",
		"Nested classes 'DecomposeTests' and 'EliminateTests' are used to group tests by method, which adds unnecessary nesting and deviates from the recommended flat structure",
		"Helper method 'CreateSquareMatrix' is duplicated in both nested classes, violating DRY principle and reducing maintainability",
		"Variable and method names are clear and descriptive throughout the tests",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, maintaining code cleanliness",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions",
		"The nested class structure makes navigation slightly more complex than a flat test class would be"
