	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'AuctionServiceTests'",
		"Nested classes are used to group tests by method under test, which improves organization but deviates from the flat structure recommendation",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern with clear and descriptive naming",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied across all tests with proper comment separators and blank line spacing",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, maintaining clean and focused test code",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] in 'GetAuction_ValidId_ReturnsMappedAuction' to avoid code duplication",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (e.g., 'customerName', 'expectedDto', 'auction')",
		"Mock setup and assertions are clear and verify correct interactions with dependencies",
		"Minor inconsistency: 'BidLessThanOrEqualToCurrentBid_ThrowsInvalidAuctionExceptionWithCorrectMessage' doesn't follow the exact naming pattern (missing method name prefix)",
		"Nested classes increase structural complexity slightly but provide good logical grouping; overall structure remains maintainable"
