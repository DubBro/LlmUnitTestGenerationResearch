		"Test class and method names follow recommended conventions (ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult).",
		"Clear AAA structure with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments, though many combine Act & Assert.",
		"Proper use of [Fact] and [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication.",
		"Shared mock setup in constructor promotes DRY and readability.",
		"Nested classes group tests by method (e.g., BetMethod), aiding organization but unconventional inheritance from outer class.",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers.",
		"Adheres to C# naming conventions for variables and mocks.",
		"Some test names are overly verbose, reducing scannability.",
		"Minor redundancies like 'int id = auction.ID;' where values are constant.",
		"Lacks strict separation of Act and Assert in exception-throwing tests."
