  "reasons": [
    "Test method names are mostly clear and follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent easy to understand (only a minor inconsistency in BidLessThanOrEqualToCurrentBid_...).",
    "Tests are well-structured using the AAA pattern with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments, which clearly separates phases and aids readability.",
    "Shared setup via the base AuctionServiceTests constructor centralizes mock creation and improves maintainability by avoiding repetition.",
    "Nested inner classes per method under test (BetMethod, CloseAuctionMethod, etc.) provide logical grouping, but introduce an inheritance layer and go against the guideline of avoiding unnecessary nested classes, slightly reducing immediate clarity for new readers.",
    "Naming of fields, variables, and DTOs (e.g., _unitOfWorkMock, auction, expectedDto) is meaningful and consistent with common C# conventions, aiding comprehension.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for GetAuction_ValidId_ReturnsMappedAuction shows appropriate parameterization to avoid duplication for that scenario, though more scenarios could potentially benefit from this pattern.",
    "Formatting is consistent (indentation, spacing, brace placement), with no extraneous comments beyond AAA markers, resulting in visually clean and scannable tests.",
    "Exception-based tests combine Act & Assert in a concise way (Assert.Throws(...)), which is idiomatic in xUnit and keeps those scenarios short and readable.",
    "Some repeated Arrange code for similar auction setups could be factored into helper methods/builders to further improve maintainability, but the current duplication is still manageable and easy to follow."
