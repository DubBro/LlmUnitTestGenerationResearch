		"Test class name follows the 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern (VectorExtensionsTests)",
		"Test names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern clearly",
		"Tests follow AAA pattern with explicit comments for Arrange, Act, Assert blocks",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for multiple input scenarios",
		"Proper separation of concerns: different test methods for null checks, validation, and functionality",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names (lhs, rhs, vector, factor, expected)",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond the AAA separators",
		"All tests are synchronous and use proper xUnit attributes ([Fact] and [Theory])",
		"Assertions are clear and focused on single responsibility per test",
		"Minor deduction: Some tests could potentially be combined using [Theory] for null check scenarios, but current structure remains very readable"
