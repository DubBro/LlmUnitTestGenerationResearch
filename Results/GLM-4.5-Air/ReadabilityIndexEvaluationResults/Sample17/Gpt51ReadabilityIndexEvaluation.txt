  "reasons": [
    "Test class and file naming follow clear and conventional patterns (VectorExtensionsTests, namespace aligned to domain).",
    "Individual test names consistently follow Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult, making intent immediately obvious.",
    "Each test strictly follows the AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert separators and spacing.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple input variations reduces duplication and keeps scenarios compact.",
    "Argument validation tests are consistently structured and easy to scan (null parameter, exception type, and ParamName checks).",
    "Assertions are straightforward and close to the Act step, improving traceability from setup to expected behavior.",
    "No nested test classes or complex test infrastructure; the class is flat and easy to navigate.",
    "Naming of variables (lhs, rhs, vector, source, factor, result, expected) is consistent and semantically meaningful in context.",
    "Formatting and whitespace are uniform, with good vertical separation between tests for quick visual parsing.",
    "Minor noise from non-essential comments (e.g., 'Already arranged by InlineData') and slightly verbose element-wise assertions prevent it from being perfectly minimal, but do not significantly harm readability."
