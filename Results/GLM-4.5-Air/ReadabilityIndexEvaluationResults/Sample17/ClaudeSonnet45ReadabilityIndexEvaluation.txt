		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comments and spacing in all tests",
		"Effective use of [Theory] and [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for multiple input scenarios",
		"Variable names are clear, meaningful, and reflect their purpose throughout",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes, keeping the structure clean",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions",
		"Exception assertions properly verify both exception type and relevant properties (ParamName, Message)",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: some [Theory] tests include '// Already arranged by InlineData' comment which is not strictly necessary per guidelines",
		"Overall excellent readability with logical grouping of related tests and very maintainable structure"
