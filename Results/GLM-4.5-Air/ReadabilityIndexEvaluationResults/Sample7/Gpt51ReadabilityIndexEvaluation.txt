  "readabilityIndex": 86,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and member names are clear and domain-specific (WalkServiceTests, _walkRepository, _walkService, validImei/invalidImei), making intent easy to understand.",
    "Each test follows the AAA pattern with clear separation via comments (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert or // Act & Assert), which improves structure and scanability.",
    "Async scenarios correctly use async Task signatures and await, matching modern C# and xUnit best practices and reducing cognitive friction.",
    "Nested classes per method under test (Get10LongestWalksAsync, GetWalksGeneralInfoAsync) provide logical grouping, aiding navigation, though they slightly increase structural complexity.",
    "Test method names use a consistent GivenX_WhenCalled_Y style combined with the nested class name to convey scenario and expectation, though they do not strictly follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
    "Assertions are explicit and readable, validating key properties clearly, though repeated calls to result.First()/Last() and duplicated error-message literals add minor noise.",
    "Similar invalid IMEI scenarios are duplicated across tests and methods rather than using [Theory] with [InlineData], which slightly reduces maintainability but does not significantly harm readability."
