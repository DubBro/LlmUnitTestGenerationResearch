		"Nested classes for grouping tests by method deviate from flat structure recommendation, potentially confusing maintenance.",
		"High code duplication in identical invalid IMEI exception tests across nested classes harms maintainability.",
		"Test names use consistent BDD style (Given_When_Expected) which is clear but not exact MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Excellent adherence to AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and clear separation.",
		"Clear, meaningful names for classes, methods, variables reflecting purpose.",
		"Proper async Task signatures for asynchronous tests.",
		"Effective shared setup via base class constructor with NSubstitute mocks.",
		"No extraneous comments or violations of C# naming conventions."
