	"readabilityIndex": 60,
	"reasons": [
		"Good use of nested test classes (Get10LongestWalksAsync, GetWalksGeneralInfoAsync) for grouping related tests, though this is not strictly required",
		"Test method names follow a descriptive Given/When/Then pattern, making them clear",
		"Tests follow the AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert comments and separation",
		"All tests are async Task methods as required",
		"Consistent structure across multiple test scenarios",
		"Clear variable naming with meaningful names like validImei and invalidImei",
		"Excessive duplication in validation test cases - similar IMEI validation tests are repeated across both nested classes",
		"Test assertions are verbose and could be more concise with fluent assertion patterns",
		"[Fact] attributes are used appropriately for single scenarios, though [Theory] could consolidate similar validation tests",
		"Good separation of concerns with clear test setup in constructor"
