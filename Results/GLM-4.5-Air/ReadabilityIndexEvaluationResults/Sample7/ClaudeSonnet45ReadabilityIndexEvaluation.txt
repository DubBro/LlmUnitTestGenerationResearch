{
	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the correct naming pattern 'WalkServiceTests' and uses proper constructor-based setup for dependencies",
		"Nested classes 'Get10LongestWalksAsync' and 'GetWalksGeneralInfoAsync' are used to group tests by method, which improves organization",
		"Test names follow a clear pattern similar to 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' using 'Given_When_Returns/Throws' convention",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"AAA pattern is consistently followed with clear separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and proper spacing",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA block separators, keeping tests clean and focused",
		"Variable naming is clear and descriptive (validImei, invalidImei, walkEntities, entity)",
		"Significant code duplication exists across validation tests - three identical IMEI validation tests are repeated in both nested classes, which could be refactored using [Theory] and [InlineData]",
		"Combined 'Act & Assert' pattern in exception tests deviates slightly from strict AAA separation but is acceptable and common practice",
		"Overall structure is maintainable with good use of mocking framework (NSubstitute) and consistent assertion patterns"
