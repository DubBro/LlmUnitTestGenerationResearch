{"readabilityIndex": 85, "reasons": ["Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern.", "Test method names follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making scenarios clear.", "Tests follow the AAA pattern with explicit comments for Arrange, Act, Assert blocks.", "No unnecessary nested classes present in test class.", "All test signatures are appropriate (no async void issues).", "Naming is consistent with C# conventions.", "Minor issue: The 'n' parameter in tests is redundant because it's always p.Length, which could be removed for clarity.", "Minor issue: The test for 'TwoMatrices' uses a magic number calculation (10 * 20 * 30) which is acceptable but could be made explicit with a constant.", "Minor issue: The 's' parameter is declared but not used in some tests, which could confuse readers about its purpose.", "Overall structure is clean and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns."]}
