  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (MatrixChainMultiplicationTests).",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making each scenario easy to understand.",
    "AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) structure is explicitly used with comments and blank-line separation, improving visual clarity.",
    "Code formatting is clean and consistent (bracing style, indentation, spacing), aiding quick scanning and comprehension.",
    "Variable naming is generally clear and conventional (result, act, n), except for domain-specific short name p which is still understandable from context.",
    "Each test covers a single, well-defined scenario, with no mixed concerns inside test methods.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested test classes are present, keeping the code uncluttered and focused.",
    "Use of Assert.Throws with an Action delegate is idiomatic and easy to read for exception tests.",
    "Some repetition in Arrange blocks (e.g., repeated pattern of p, n, s setup) slightly reduces maintainability; shared setup helpers or test data builders could improve this.",
    "Matrix indices and values for the s array are somewhat “magic” and lack explanatory abstraction, making those specific tests a bit harder to understand and maintain."
