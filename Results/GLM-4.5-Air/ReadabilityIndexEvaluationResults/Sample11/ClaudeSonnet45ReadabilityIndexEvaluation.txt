		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with clear separation using comments and empty lines",
		"No unnecessary comments outside of AAA block separators",
		"Standard C# naming conventions are properly followed throughout",
		"Good use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios",
		"Slight code duplication with 'out s' parameter and 'int n = p.Length' across multiple tests could be reduced",
		"Variable names are generally clear, though 'p', 'n', and 's' are cryptic and could be more descriptive",
		"Tests are well-structured and easy to understand despite some minor naming issues",
		"No nested classes and overall maintainability is good"
