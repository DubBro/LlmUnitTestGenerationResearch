		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern (AsciiHelpersTests)",
		"Test methods consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' naming pattern",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with comment separators and blank lines between sections",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing different replacement characters",
		"Nested classes are used to group tests by method under test, which adds organization but deviates from the recommendation against unnecessary nesting",
		"Variable naming is clear and meaningful (input, replacement, result, expected)",
		"Code follows standard C# and .NET naming conventions consistently",
		"No extraneous comments beyond AAA separators, maintaining clean code",
		"The nested class structure creates an additional layer that could be simplified by incorporating method names directly into test names",
		"Overall structure is logical and maintainable with good consistency across all test methods"
