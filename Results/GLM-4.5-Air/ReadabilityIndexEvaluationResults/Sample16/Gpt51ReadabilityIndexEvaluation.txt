    "Test method names clearly follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent immediately obvious.",
    "Test class name AsciiHelpersTests clearly indicates the unit under test and follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention.",
    "Each test consistently follows the AAA (Arrange–Act–Assert) pattern with separating comments, improving scanability.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for varying replacement characters reduces duplication and clarifies scenario coverage.",
    "Variable names like input, replacement, result, and expected are simple, consistent, and descriptive enough for the context.",
    "Formatting, spacing, and brace style are consistent throughout, aiding quick visual parsing.",
    "No extraneous comments beyond AAA separators; the code is self-explanatory through naming.",
    "Nested public classes per method under test slightly increase structural complexity and nesting depth, making navigation marginally less straightforward.",
    "Some minor repetition between null/empty/whitespace cases could be consolidated with theories, which would further improve maintainability without sacrificing clarity."
