		"Test class and method names follow the recommended patterns (ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult).",
		"All tests adhere strictly to the AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and proper separation.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for variations, reducing duplication.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names reflecting purpose.",
		"No extraneous comments or code outside the ideal structure.",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions.",
		"Nested classes logically group tests by method, aiding navigation despite deviation from flat structure ideal.",
		"Minimal duplication across similar edge-case tests, with distinct scenarios clearly named."
