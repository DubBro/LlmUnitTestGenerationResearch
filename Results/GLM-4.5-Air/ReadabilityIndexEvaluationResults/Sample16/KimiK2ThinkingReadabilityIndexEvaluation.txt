		"Unnecessary nested classes (ReplaceNonAsciiCharsWith, RemoveNonAsciiChars) violate the guideline for flat test class structure, reducing maintainability",
		"Non-standard namespace naming (Glm45AirUnitTests) deviates from conventional hierarchical namespace practices",
		"Excellent adherence to AAA pattern with clear comments and proper separation in all tests",
		"Very good test method naming consistently follows MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory]/[InlineData] for parameter variations",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names (input, replacement, result, expected) throughout all tests",
		"No extraneous comments beyond AAA separators, keeping tests clean and focused",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test cases improves scanability"
