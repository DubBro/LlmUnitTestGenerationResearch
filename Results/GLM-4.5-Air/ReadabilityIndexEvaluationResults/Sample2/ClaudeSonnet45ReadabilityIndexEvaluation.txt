	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the 'ClassUnderTestTests' naming pattern correctly",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with comments and proper spacing in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for validation scenarios",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout (e.g., expectedEntity, filteredEntities)",
		"Consistent constructor-based test fixture setup using NSubstitute",
		"Some test data setup is verbose with repetitive EmployeeModel/EmployeeEntity initialization that could be extracted to helper methods",
		"Magic values in arrange blocks (e.g., department IDs, position IDs) could be extracted as named constants for better maintainability",
		"Overall structure is clean, logical, and easy to follow with only minor opportunities for refactoring"
