  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (`EmployeeServiceTests`) and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent easy to understand.",
    "All async tests correctly use `async Task` and not `async void`, aligning with best practices and improving maintainability.",
    "AAA pattern is followed in almost all tests with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments and spacing, making structure very clear.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for validation scenarios (names, dates, salary, etc.) avoids some duplication and improves clarity of input variations.",
    "Mocks/substitutes are clearly named (`_employeeRepositorySubstitute`, `_employeeService`) and created in the constructor, centralizing setup.",
    "There is substantial repetition in constructing similar `EmployeeModel` and `EmployeeEntity` instances across many tests, which hurts maintainability and could be improved with helper methods or builders.",
    "Long inline object initializers with many properties (especially in the first few tests) add visual noise and make it harder to see what is actually relevant for each scenario.",
    "Use of various magic constants (dates, salaries, IDs, long strings) directly in tests slightly reduces readability; extracting commonly used values to named constants or factory methods would clarify intent.",
    "Overall file is long but logically grouped around `EmployeeService` operations, with no nested test classes or unrelated concerns, keeping navigation reasonably straightforward."
