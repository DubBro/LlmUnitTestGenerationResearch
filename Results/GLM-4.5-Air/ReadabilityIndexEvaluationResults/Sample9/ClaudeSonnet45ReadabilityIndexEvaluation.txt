		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comment separators and empty lines between sections",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful, enhancing code readability",
		"Standard C# and .NET naming conventions are followed throughout",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
		"Minor issue: The comment '// Parameters provided by InlineData' in Arrange sections of Theory tests is somewhat redundant but not critical",
		"Code structure is consistent across all tests, making it easy to understand and maintain",
		"Good separation of concerns with each test focusing on a specific scenario"
