    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names strictly follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult convention and are self-explanatory.",
    "Consistent use of AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and blank-line separation improves scanability.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests is appropriate and avoids duplication.",
    "Local variable names (minWords, maxSentences, numParagraphs, etc.) are clear, descriptive, and reflect their purpose.",
    "Code formatting (indentation, line breaks, and argument wrapping) is clean and consistent, making the tests easy to follow.",
    "Assertions are generally straightforward and close to the Act step, preserving a clear logical flow.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or complex fixtures; the test class remains flat and simple to navigate.",
    "Some minor duplication in Arrange sections (repeated parameter sets) could be abstracted or more heavily parameterized to improve maintainability.",
    "A small number of inline comments like 'Parameters provided by InlineData' are unnecessary noise, slightly detracting from the otherwise clean structure."
