	"reasons": [
		"Redundant test 'GetAsync_WhenCalledThroughInterface_ReturnsMappedModel' duplicates logic of the first test, creating maintenance burden and confusion",
		"Vague expected result in test name 'GetAsync_WithDefaultId_UsesDefaultId' does not clearly describe the outcome",
		"All tests correctly follow the AAA pattern with clear comments and blank line separation",
		"Test class name 'CompanyServiceTests' follows the required naming convention",
		"Proper use of 'async Task' signatures for asynchronous tests",
		"Correct application of standard C# naming conventions for variables and fields",
		"Appropriate use of '[Fact]' attribute as scenarios don't require parameterized testing",
		"Test setup in the constructor promotes DRY principles for common dependencies",
		"Test method names mostly follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"Code is free of unnecessary comments, maintaining focus on test logic"
