  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `CompanyServiceTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are descriptive.",
    "AAA pattern is clearly used and explicitly marked with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, improving scanability.",
    "Async tests correctly use `async Task` signatures and `await`, avoiding `async void` pitfalls.",
    "Field and variable names (_companyRepository, entity, model, result) are self-explanatory and adhere to C# naming conventions.",
    "Setup via constructor with shared test doubles reduces boilerplate and keeps Arrange sections focused.",
    "No extraneous comments beyond AAA markers; the code is clean and uncluttered.",
    "Use of NSubstitute and AutoMapper is straightforward and idiomatic, making the intent of each test easy to follow.",
    "There is some minor duplication in entity/model construction that could be extracted to helpers or test data builders for even better maintainability.",
    "One test creates local substitutes instead of using the shared fields, introducing a small inconsistency in setup style but still remaining understandable."
