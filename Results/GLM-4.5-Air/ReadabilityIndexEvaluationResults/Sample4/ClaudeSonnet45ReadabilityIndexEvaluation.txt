		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators and blank line separation",
		"Async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful throughout all tests",
		"Dependencies are properly mocked and initialized in the constructor, promoting DRY principle",
		"The last test 'GetAsync_WhenCalledThroughInterface_ReturnsMappedModel' creates duplicate mocks locally instead of reusing class-level fields, reducing maintainability and adding confusion about its purpose",
		"No use of [Theory] with [InlineData] where it could eliminate duplication between similar test scenarios (e.g., tests with different IDs could be parameterized)",
		"Assertions verify both return values and mock interactions consistently across all tests",
		"Code adheres to standard C# and .NET naming conventions"
