	"reasons": [
		"Test class and method names are clear and follow recommended patterns (ClassUnderTestTests, MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult).",
		"AAA pattern is consistently followed with clear Arrange, Act, Assert comments and separation.",
		"Tests use proper async Task signatures instead of async void.",
		"Good use of mocks/substitutes with NSubstitute, though some test data duplication exists between tests.",
		"Test scenarios are logically organized with clear setup in constructor and per-test arrangements.",
		"Assertions verify both results and mock interactions appropriately.",
		"One test has vague scenario description ('WithDefaultId_UsesDefaultId') - could be more explicit about the optional parameter scenario.",
		"Fourth test creates local mocks instead of using class-level fields, slightly inconsistent but acceptable.",
		"No use of Theory/InlineData for parameterized tests where appropriate (e.g., testing different IDs).",
		"Overall structure is clean with good separation of concerns and minimal unnecessary code."
