    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and make the intent of each test immediately clear.",
    "Consistent AAA structure with clear separation of Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks improves scanability and comprehension.",
    "Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory]/[InlineData] for parameterized cases reduces duplication and clarifies varying inputs.",
    "Code uses clear, meaningful variable names and adheres to standard C# naming conventions, aiding maintainability.",
    "Minor duplication in creating FisherYatesShuffler<int> instances across tests is acceptable but could be refactored into shared setup for even better readability."
