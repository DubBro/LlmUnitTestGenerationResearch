		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern clearly",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied across all tests with proper comment separators",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout (shuffler, array, originalArray, seed)",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA block separators",
		"Proper spacing and formatting with empty lines separating AAA blocks",
		"Standard C# naming conventions are followed consistently",
		"One minor issue: 'Act & Assert' combined in the last test deviates slightly from strict AAA separation, though this is acceptable for exception testing",
		"Overall excellent readability with minimal room for improvement"
