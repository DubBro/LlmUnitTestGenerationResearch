  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, meaningful, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns.",
    "All async tests correctly use async Task signatures, matching xUnit best practices.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently applied and explicitly marked with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert, making test flow easy to follow.",
    "Dependencies are initialized once in the constructor, avoiding repetition and improving maintainability.",
    "Code uses standard C# naming conventions and consistent formatting, which improves scan-ability.",
    "Test scenarios are small, focused, and logically separated, aiding quick understanding of each behavior.",
    "Assertions are explicit and straightforward, comparing individual properties for clarity.",
    "There is some repetition in constructing similar DepartmentEntity and DepartmentModel instances that could be extracted into helper methods or builders to reduce duplication.",
    "The use of null! for expectedDepartmentModel.Name may be confusing to readers and slightly hurts clarity.",
    "Collection assertions in the ListAsync test rely on a manual for-loop and ElementAt, which is readable but a bit verbose compared to dedicated collection assertion helpers."
