		"Test class name follows 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"Clear AAA pattern with explicit comments separating blocks",
		"Proper async Task signature for asynchronous tests",
		"Good variable naming that reflects purpose",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation",
