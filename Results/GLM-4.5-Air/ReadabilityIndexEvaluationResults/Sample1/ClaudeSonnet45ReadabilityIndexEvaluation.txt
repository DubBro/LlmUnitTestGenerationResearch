		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"AAA pattern is clearly followed with explicit comments and empty line separation in all tests",
		"Variable and field naming is clear and follows C# conventions",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping tests clean",
		"Setup through constructor promotes DRY principle and reduces duplication",
		"Assertion logic is repetitive (comparing each property individually) - could be improved with object comparison or custom assertion helpers",
		"Some duplication in test data setup (DepartmentEntity and DepartmentModel creation) could be extracted to helper methods",
		"Minor: 'expectedDepartmentEntity' and 'expectedDepartmentModel' naming could be simplified to 'entity' and 'expected' for brevity without losing clarity"
