		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"Proper use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests, avoiding code duplication",
		"Clear AAA pattern separation with appropriate comments and blank lines in all tests",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping code clean and focused",
		"Meaningful variable names that clearly express their purpose (e.g., 'originalText', 'encodedText', 'decodedText')",
		"Comprehensive test coverage scenarios including edge cases (null, empty, wrapping, negative keys)",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test methods",
		"Appropriate use of inline data for boundary testing (uppercase, lowercase, wrapping)",
		"Minor observation: empty Arrange sections in some Theory tests could be removed, but this does not significantly impact readability"
