    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (CaesarEncoderTests).",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are descriptive.",
    "AAA pattern is clearly used in all tests with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and blank-line separation, improving scanability.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple input variations is appropriate and reduces duplication.",
    "Parameter names in theory tests (text, key, expectedResult) are clear and self-explanatory.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments; the file is structurally simple and easy to navigate.",
    "Code style and naming conventions (PascalCase for methods/classes, camelCase for variables) adhere to standard C# and .NET guidelines.",
    "InlineData sets are well-organized and grouped logically, making intent of each theory test understandable.",
    "Arrange blocks are minimal and focused, avoiding noise and helping maintain clarity of what each test is setting up.",
    "Symmetry between Encode and Decode test sets improves mental mapping and maintainability when updating test cases."
