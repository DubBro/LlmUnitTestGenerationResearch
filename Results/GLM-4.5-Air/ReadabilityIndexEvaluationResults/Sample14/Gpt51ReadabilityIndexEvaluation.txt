  "readabilityIndex": 73,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names follow clear, descriptive patterns (ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult), which makes test intent easy to understand.",
    "AAA structure is present and visually separated, which improves scanability and comprehension of each test.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for invalid parameters avoids duplication and clearly expresses parameterized scenarios.",
    "All tests are synchronous and correctly use void/Task signatures (no async issues), keeping the flow straightforward.",
    "The second test method is very long, with a large block of repetitive Assert.Equal calls, which makes it harder to scan and reason about failures.",
    "Extensive use of magic numbers for both indices and expected values in the 2D array without helper methods or named constants reduces readability and maintainability.",
    "Comments like \"First quarter\", \"Second quarter\" etc. try to structure the asserts but are not fully clear in terms of what logical behavior is being tested, adding cognitive load.",
    "Use of comments other than // Arrange, // Act, // Assert (e.g., \"No additional arrangement needed.\") adds minor noise without improving clarity.",
    "The tests directly assert many individual cells instead of using helper methods or custom assertions (e.g., comparing to an expected 2D array), which would be more expressive and easier to maintain."
