	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the naming convention 'ClassUnderTestTests' (RhombusGeneratorTests)",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly followed with comment separators in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for invalid input scenarios",
		"Excessive number of individual Assert statements (25 in second test) significantly reduces readability and maintainability",
		"Comments like '// First quarter', '// Second quarter' indicate redundant verification logic that could be refactored",
		"The comment '// No additional arrangement needed.' in the Arrange section is unnecessary noise",
		"Hard-coded array index assertions make tests brittle and difficult to understand the expected pattern",
		"Tests would benefit from helper methods or structured comparison (e.g., comparing expected vs actual arrays) instead of element-by-element assertions",
		"Overall structure is good, but assertion verbosity severely impacts maintainability"
