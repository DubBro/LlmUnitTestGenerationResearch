		"Excessive assertion duplication: second test contains 25+ individual Assert.Equal calls for array elements",
		"Non-AAA comments ('// First quarter', '// Second quarter') violate readability guidelines",
		"Hard-coded element checks make tests brittle and require extensive updates for minor changes",
		"Lack of helper methods or array comparison operations leads to unnecessary verbosity",
		"First test also suffers from multiple explicit assertions that could be simplified",
		"Overall assertion structure obscures the actual test intent and expected rhombus pattern"
