		"Clear, conventional naming for test class and methods following MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Consistent AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and proper separation",
		"Effective use of [Theory] and [InlineData] for invalid count scenarios to avoid code duplication",
		"Verbose, repetitive individual Assert.Equal calls for matrix cells reduce scannability",
		"Lengthy assertion blocks in larger odd count test are difficult to read and maintain",
		"Extra comment inside Arrange block ('No additional arrangement needed') violates no-extra-comments guideline",
		"Inconsistent sub-grouping of assertions in second test with partial overlaps"
