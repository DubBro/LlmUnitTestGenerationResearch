        "Clear test class and method naming following standard patterns.",
        "Well-structured AAA pattern with explicit block separators and comments.",
        "Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple invalid input cases, reducing duplication.",
        "Excessive repetitive assertions in second test make the test long and hard to verify visually.",
        "Lack of helper methods or test data builders to reduce duplication and improve clarity in large assertions.",
        "Hard-coded expected values in assertions could be extracted to well-named variables for better readability.",
        "Some assertions are grouped by logical sections (quarters) with comments, which aids understanding.",
        "No unnecessary nested classes or complex setup.",
        "Assert.Throws used correctly for exception testing.",
        "Tests are generally logical and maintainable despite verbosity in one test."
