  "reasons": [
    "Test and variable names are clear, descriptive, and consistently express Given_When_Then-style scenarios, making intent easy to understand.",
    "Tests are grouped logically by method under test via nested classes (GetFolderAsync, GetRootFoldersAsync, AddFolderAsync), which helps navigation and organization.",
    "AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) is followed consistently in almost all tests with clear comment separators and blank lines, improving visual structure.",
    "Asynchronous tests correctly use async Task signatures and xUnit’s async assertion methods, avoiding readability issues related to async void.",
    "Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests reduces duplication and clarifies scenario variation.",
    "Mock setup and verification with NSubstitute is readable and consistently placed in Arrange and Assert sections, making dependencies and expectations clear.",
    "Some object initializers and lines are quite dense and long (e.g., nested FolderEntity initializations), which slightly reduces scanability and could be split across multiple lines for better readability.",
    "Nested public classes under FolderServiceTests deviate from the more conventional flat test-class-per-SUT or per-method pattern and may slightly hinder discoverability for some teams, though they are logically named.",
    "There is minor inconsistency where some tests use \"// Act & Assert\" instead of separate Act and Assert blocks, and one test misses an Arrange comment around the first line, slightly breaking structural uniformity.",
    "There is a bit of repeated assertion logic (e.g., multiple tests validating root folder DTO shape) that could be extracted into helper methods to improve maintainability without harming clarity."
