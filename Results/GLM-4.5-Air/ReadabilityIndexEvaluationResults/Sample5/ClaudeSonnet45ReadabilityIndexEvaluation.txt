{
	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class uses nested classes (GetFolderAsync, GetRootFoldersAsync, AddFolderAsync) which contradicts the recommendation against unnecessary nested classes and complicates navigation",
		"Test names use Given_When_Then pattern instead of the recommended MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, though they remain clear and descriptive",
		"AAA pattern is consistently followed with clear comment separators and proper spacing between blocks, enhancing readability",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple input variations (invalid names, long names)",
		"Variable and field naming is clear and follows C# conventions (_folderRepositorySubstitute, _folderService)",
		"Test setup is well-organized in constructor, making dependencies and initialization explicit",
		"Assertions are comprehensive and verify both return values and mock interactions using NSubstitute's Received() method",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators; code is self-documenting through descriptive variable names",
		"Minor inconsistency: some tests combine Act & Assert blocks for exception testing, though this is acceptable practice"
