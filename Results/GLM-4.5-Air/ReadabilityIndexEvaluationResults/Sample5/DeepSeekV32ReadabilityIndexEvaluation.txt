		"Test class names follow the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (FolderServiceTests).",
		"Test method names use a clear Given-When-Then naming convention (GivenNullPath_WhenCalled_ThenReturnsRootFolderWithSubFolders).",
		"Tests follow AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert sections marked with comments.",
		"Good use of Theory with InlineData for parameterized tests to avoid code duplication.",
		"Good setup in constructor with mocked dependencies.",
		"Assertions are clear and readable with descriptive values.",
		"Nested test classes are used to group tests by method (GetFolderAsync, GetRootFoldersAsync, AddFolderAsync), which slightly reduces readability compared to flat structure but provides logical grouping.",
		"Test methods are asynchronous and properly return Task.",
		"Variable names are meaningful and reflect their purpose.",
		"Violation: Use of nested test classes, while not strictly prohibited, adds extra indirection and deviates from standard xUnit conventions. This is the primary readability concern."
