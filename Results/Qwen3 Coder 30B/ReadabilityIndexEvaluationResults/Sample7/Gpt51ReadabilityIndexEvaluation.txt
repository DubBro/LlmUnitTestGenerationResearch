  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult convention and describe intent well",
    "All async tests correctly use async Task signatures, improving clarity and preventing hidden issues",
    "AAA pattern is consistently applied and visually separated with comments and blank lines",
    "Naming of variables and test data (imei, walkEntities, walkInfoEntity, result) is clear and domain-specific",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for input variations is appropriate and consistent",
    "Assertions are straightforward, explicit, and ordered logically, making expected outcomes easy to understand",
    "Setup with NSubstitute in the constructor is simple and avoids duplication of mock creation",
    "No extraneous comments or dead code; the file is compact and focused on behavior under test",
    "Minor duplication of invalid IMEI test cases across two methods could be reduced via shared data, but it does not significantly hinder readability"
