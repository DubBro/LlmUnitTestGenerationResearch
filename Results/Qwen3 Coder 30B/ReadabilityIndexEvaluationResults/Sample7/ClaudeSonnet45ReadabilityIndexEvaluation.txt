	"readabilityIndex": 78,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators and blank lines between sections",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple invalid IMEI scenarios",
		"Async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Variable and field names are clear and meaningful (imei, walkEntities, resultList)",
		"Constructor-based test fixture setup is clean and properly uses dependency injection with mocking",
		"Minor issue: The Arrange section in invalid IMEI tests is empty but still marked with a comment, which could be omitted for cleaner code",
		"Minor issue: Multiple granular assertions in the first test could potentially be grouped or use assertion helpers for better maintainability",
		"Overall structure is logical, well-formatted, and easy to understand with consistent code style throughout"
