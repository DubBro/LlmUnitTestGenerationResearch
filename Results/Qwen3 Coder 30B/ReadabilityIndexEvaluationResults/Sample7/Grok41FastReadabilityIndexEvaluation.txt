		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names adhere to MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single cases and [Theory] with [InlineData] for variations.",
		"All async tests correctly use async Task signatures.",
		"Consistent AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and empty line separations.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable and property names reflecting purpose.",
		"Shared setup in constructor reduces duplication and improves maintainability.",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
		"Minor flaw: empty // Arrange sections in invalid IMEI theory tests could be omitted.",
