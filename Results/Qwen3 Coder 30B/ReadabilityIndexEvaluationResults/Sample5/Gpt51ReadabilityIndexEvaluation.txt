  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `FolderServiceTests` clearly follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention and indicates the SUT.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent immediately clear.",
    "All async tests correctly use async Task signatures and are clearly structured with AAA comments (or Act & Assert for exception scenarios).",
    "Arrangements are generally short and close to the assertions, making setup data and expectations easy to correlate.",
    "Use of NSubstitute is straightforward and readable, with mocks configured in a way that closely reflects the scenarios being tested.",
    "Some duplication in test setup (repeated folder entities and repository setups) slightly harms maintainability and could be extracted into helpers/builders.",
    "Multiple validation scenarios for AddFolderAsync are implemented as separate Facts instead of a Theory with InlineData, leading to minor repetition.",
    "Use of magic numbers and strings in assertions (e.g., hardcoded IDs, names, counts) slightly reduces expressiveness compared to named constants or variables.",
    "DTO/entity variable names are mostly clear, but occasional mixing of 'Dto' naming with entity instances (e.g., folderDto vs FolderEntity) can cause minor cognitive friction"
