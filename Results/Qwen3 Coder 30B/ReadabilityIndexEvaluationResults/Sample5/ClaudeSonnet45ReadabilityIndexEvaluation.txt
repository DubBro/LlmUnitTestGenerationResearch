		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comments separating Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks",
		"Async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (rootFolders, folderDto1, result, etc.)",
		"No code duplication; tests are well-structured and each focuses on a single scenario",
		"Constructor-based setup for dependencies is clean and follows best practices",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping code clean",
		"Proper use of [Fact] attribute for single scenarios; could potentially use [Theory] for some validation tests but current approach is acceptable",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions throughout"
