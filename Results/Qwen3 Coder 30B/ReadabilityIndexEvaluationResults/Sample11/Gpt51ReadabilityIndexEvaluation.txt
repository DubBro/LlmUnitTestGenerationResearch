  "readabilityIndex": 92,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_Result patterns.",
    "Tests consistently follow the AAA pattern with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and spacing, which makes the flow easy to follow.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to cover multiple input variations avoids duplication and improves test intent clarity.",
    "Variable names (p, n, s, result, expected) are short but domain-appropriate for matrix chain multiplication and still understandable.",
    "Each test covers a single, focused scenario, resulting in short, readable test bodies.",
    "Async is not misused; all tests are synchronous for synchronous methods, aligning signatures with behavior.",
    "Code style and naming largely follow standard C#/.NET conventions, contributing to consistency and readability.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested classes; the tests are structurally simple and easy to scan.",
    "Minor readability issue: the unused expectedS variable in the first test introduces slight noise and could be removed.",
    "Slight reliance on magic numbers (indices and dimensions) without helper methods or named constants may slow understanding for new readers but is still manageable for this domain-specific case."
