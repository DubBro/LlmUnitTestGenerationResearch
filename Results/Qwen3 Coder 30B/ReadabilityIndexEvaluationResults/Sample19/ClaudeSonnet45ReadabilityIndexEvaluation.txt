		"Test class name follows the correct pattern (StringExtensionsTests)",
		"All test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented and clearly marked with comments in all tests",
		"Good separation between logical blocks with empty lines throughout all tests",
		"One test uses [Theory] with [InlineData] appropriately to reduce code duplication (ToCsvCompatible_StringContainsSpecialChars_ReturnsQuotedString)",
		"Some opportunities for additional use of [Theory] were missed (e.g., IsInteger null/empty/whitespace tests, IsNumber null/empty/whitespace tests could be consolidated)",
		"Variable naming is clear and consistent, though some could be more descriptive (e.g., 's' could be 'input' or 'value')",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, maintaining clean code",
		"All tests follow standard C# and .NET naming conventions consistently",
		"Overall structure is logical and easy to navigate, with minor room for reducing repetition through more parameterized tests"
