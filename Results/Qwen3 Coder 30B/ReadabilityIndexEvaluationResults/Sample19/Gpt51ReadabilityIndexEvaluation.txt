    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (StringExtensionsTests), making its purpose immediately clear.",
    "Individual test names consistently use the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult convention, which clearly expresses intent.",
    "All tests follow a clean AAA structure with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and blank-line separation, improving scanability.",
    "Formatting, indentation, and brace style are consistent throughout, making the code visually easy to follow.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments; each test is self-contained and focused on a single scenario.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for ToCsvCompatible special character cases reduces duplication and clarifies a shared scenario.",
    "Local variable names (s, c) are short but still understandable in context; however, slightly more descriptive names (e.g., input) could improve clarity further.",
    "There is some repetitive structure across similar tests (IsInteger, IsNumber, Reverse, GetFileExtension) that could be consolidated into additional [Theory]-based tests to reduce duplication and improve maintainability."
