	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comments and blank line separation in most tests",
		"Naming conventions are clear and meaningful throughout the code",
		"Good use of NSubstitute for mocking dependencies with readable setup",
		"Minor inconsistency: some tests combine Act & Assert sections which slightly deviates from strict AAA separation",
		"Unused 'exception' variables are declared but never used, adding minor noise to the code",
		"Could benefit from [Theory] with [InlineData] to reduce duplication across similar validation tests (e.g., multiple InvalidIdException tests)",
		"Constructor setup of mocks is clean and promotes maintainability",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping the code clean"
	]
