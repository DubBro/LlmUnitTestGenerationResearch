  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (AuctionServiceTests), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent and behavior easy to understand.",
    "Consistent use of AAA structure with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments improves scanability and structure.",
    "Constructor-based setup for shared mocks (_unitOfWork, _mapper, _auctionService) keeps individual tests focused and reduces clutter.",
    "Variable names (id, customerName, bid, auction, auctionDto) are clear and descriptive, aiding readability.",
    "Tests are logically grouped by method under test (Bet, CloseAuction, GetAuction, GetAuctions, OpenAuction), which helps navigation and maintenance.",
    "No unnecessary nested test classes or unrelated comments; the file is structurally simple and easy to follow.",
    "There is noticeable duplication in Arrange sections for similar scenarios (e.g., repeated Auction object creation) which could be reduced with helpers or data-driven tests.",
    "Several scenarios that differ only by input values use separate [Fact] tests instead of [Theory] with [InlineData], slightly impacting maintainability and conciseness."
