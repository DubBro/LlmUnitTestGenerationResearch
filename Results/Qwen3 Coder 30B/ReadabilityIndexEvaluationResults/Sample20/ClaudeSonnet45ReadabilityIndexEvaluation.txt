		"Test class name follows the correct 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with clear comment separators in all tests",
		"Good use of [Theory] and [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for similar scenarios",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful throughout the tests",
		"Proper use of generic types demonstrates understanding of the class under test",
		"Some comments within Assert blocks ('// No exception thrown...', '// Elements are still present...') violate the guideline of only using AAA comments",
		"The assertions in probabilistic shuffle tests are weak and could be more precise, affecting maintainability",
		"Good separation of concerns with empty lines between AAA blocks in most tests",
		"Overall structure is clean, logical, and easy to follow with only minor readability issues"
