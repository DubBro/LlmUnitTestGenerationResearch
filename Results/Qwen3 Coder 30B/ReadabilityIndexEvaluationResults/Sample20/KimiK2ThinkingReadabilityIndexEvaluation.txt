	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Additional comments beyond AAA blocks violate explicit readability guidelines",
		"Test name 'Shuffle_ArrayWithSeed_NullSeedUsesDefaultRandom' is misleading (mentions 'WithSeed' but tests null seed)",
		"Repetitive assertions in theory test reduce maintainability and clarity",
		"'Shuffle_ArrayWithMultipleElements_ShufflesWithSeed' doesn't verify shuffling behavior as name implies",
		"Good AAA pattern implementation with clear separation and proper spacing",
		"Consistent and appropriate use of Fact and Theory attributes",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout all tests",
		"Proper test class naming following ClassUnderTestTests pattern",
		"Most test names follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult convention",
		"Minimal code duplication with only minor repetition in array copying"
