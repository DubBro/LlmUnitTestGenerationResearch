  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `FisherYatesShufflerTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention, making the subject under test obvious.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and accurately describe behavior, aiding quick understanding.",
    "AAA structure is used in all tests with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments (or `// Act & Assert`), and logical separation with blank lines, which makes test flow easy to follow.",
    "Use of `[Fact]` for single scenarios and `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple input variations is appropriate and avoids duplication of similar tests.",
    "Variable naming (`shuffler`, `array`, `original`, `seed`) is simple, consistent, and self-explanatory, contributing to clarity.",
    "No nested test classes and a small, cohesive set of tests for one responsibility keeps the file structure straightforward and maintainable.",
    "Assertions are direct and readable (`Assert.Empty`, `Assert.Equal`, `Assert.Contains`, `Assert.Throws`), with no overly complex or chained expressions.",
    "Redundant explanatory comments inside Assert blocks (beyond AAA markers) add minor noise and slightly reduce the overall cleanliness of the tests.",
    "Repeated creation of `FisherYatesShuffler<T>` in each test introduces a bit of boilerplate that could be factored out into setup to improve maintainability.",
    "Some tests could use more expressive collection assertions (e.g., checking all expected elements in a loop or via set comparison), which would reduce repetition and further improve readability."
