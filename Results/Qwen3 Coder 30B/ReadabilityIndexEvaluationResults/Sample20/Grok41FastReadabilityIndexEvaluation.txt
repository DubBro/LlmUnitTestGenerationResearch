		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern perfectly.",
		"Test method names adhere closely to MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Consistent use of AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and separation.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] and [Theory] with [InlineData] to handle variations without duplication.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable and parameter names throughout.",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes; adheres to conventions.",
		"Minor flaw: Act & Assert combined in one test, slightly deviating from strict separation.",
		"Repetitive hardcoded Contains assertions in theories reduce conciseness slightly.",
		"Array copying logic is clear but manual.",
		"Overall structure is logical, maintainable, and easy to read."
