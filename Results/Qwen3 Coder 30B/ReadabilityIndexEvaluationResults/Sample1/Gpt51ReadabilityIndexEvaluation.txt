    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the recommended ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_Result patterns.",
    "AAA structure is explicitly followed and clearly separated with Arrange/Act/Assert comments, improving scanability.",
    "Async tests correctly use async Task signatures, matching best practices for asynchronous test methods.",
    "Dependencies (repository, service) are created locally in each test, making each test self-contained and easy to understand in isolation.",
    "Assertions are straightforward and explicit, clearly verifying the key properties of the returned models.",
    "Code style and naming follow standard C# conventions, with no unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
    "Minor readability issues such as repeated ElementAt calls instead of indexers and repeated Arrange setup slightly reduce optimal clarity and maintainability."
