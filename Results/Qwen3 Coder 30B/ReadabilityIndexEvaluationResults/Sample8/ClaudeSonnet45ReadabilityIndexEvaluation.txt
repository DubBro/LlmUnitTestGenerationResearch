	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (LuTests)",
		"All test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern clearly",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied and properly marked with comments in all tests",
		"Logical blocks are well separated by empty lines improving visual structure",
		"Standard C# and .NET naming conventions are followed throughout",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (source, matrix, coefficients, result)",
		"Minor issue: assertion in Eliminate test uses precision parameter (10) without explanation, potentially confusing",
		"Minor issue: no [Theory] usage even though multiple matrix scenarios could be parameterized to reduce duplication",
		"Overall structure is clean, maintainable, and easy to understand with only minor optimization opportunities"
