  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LuTests` clearly associates tests with the `Lu` class and follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern.",
    "Test method names follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` convention and make intent obvious (e.g., `Decompose_SourceMatrixIsNotSquare_ThrowsArgumentException`).",
    "Each test cleanly follows the AAA pattern with explicit `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments and visual separation.",
    "Naming of local variables (`source`, `matrix`, `coefficients`, `result`) is clear and domain-appropriate, aiding quick understanding.",
    "Code style and formatting are consistent with standard C# conventions, with no unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
    "Minor possible improvements include using slightly more descriptive test class and variable names (e.g., `LuDecompositionTests`, `sourceMatrix`) and extracting common object setup if the class grows, but these do not significantly hurt readability in the current size."
