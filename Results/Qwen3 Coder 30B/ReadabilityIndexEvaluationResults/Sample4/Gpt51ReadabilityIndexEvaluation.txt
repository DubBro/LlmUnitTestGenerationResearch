  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (CompanyServiceTests), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and clearly describe behavior (e.g., GetAsync_ValidId_ReturnsMappedCompanyModel).",
    "AAA pattern is explicitly used, with clear separation via comments and spacing, making test flow easy to follow.",
    "Asynchronous tests use async Task signatures correctly and avoid async void, aiding clarity and correctness of usage.",
    "xUnit attributes are used appropriately: [Fact] for a single scenario and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple variations of the same scenario.",
    "Some duplication in Arrange setup (repository, mapper, service creation) slightly reduces maintainability and could be improved with common setup helpers or fixtures."
