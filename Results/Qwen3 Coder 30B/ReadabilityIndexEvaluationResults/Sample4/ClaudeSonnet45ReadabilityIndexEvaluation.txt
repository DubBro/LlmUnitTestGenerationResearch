		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern clearly",
		"Proper use of async Task signatures for asynchronous test methods",
		"Clear AAA pattern implementation with comment separators and empty lines between blocks",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for multiple input scenarios",
		"Variable names are meaningful and self-explanatory (companyEntity, companyRepository, expectedModel)",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions throughout",
		"Minor issue: assertions could be simplified using Assert.Equivalent or custom object comparison instead of field-by-field checks",
		"Minor issue: some code duplication between the two tests in the Arrange block setup pattern",
		"Overall structure is clean with no unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments"
