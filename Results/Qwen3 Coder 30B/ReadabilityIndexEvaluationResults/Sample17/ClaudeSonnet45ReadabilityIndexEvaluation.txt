		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comments separating Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks",
		"Tests are well-structured with appropriate blank lines separating logical blocks",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (vector, lhs, rhs, result, factor, source)",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
		"Proper use of const for the immutable 'factor' variable shows good coding practice",
		"Tests cover both happy path and error scenarios with appropriate exception assertions",
		"No code duplication; each test is focused on a single scenario",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: could use [Theory] with [InlineData] for some similar scenarios, but current approach is also acceptable for clarity"
