    "Test class name `VectorExtensionsTests` clearly maps to the class/extension under test and follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are descriptive of intent.",
    "Each test follows the AAA pattern with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) sections and good vertical spacing.",
    "Code is well-formatted, uses standard C# naming conventions, and avoids unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
    "Individual tests are small, focused on a single behavior, and easy to scan and understand.",
    "Use of xUnit attributes (`[Fact]`) is appropriate and consistent for single-scenario tests.",
    "Minor issues: namespace `Qwen3Coder30BUnitTests` is not domain-descriptive, and some assertions (e.g., checking full exception messages) slightly reduce clarity by adding brittle detail."
