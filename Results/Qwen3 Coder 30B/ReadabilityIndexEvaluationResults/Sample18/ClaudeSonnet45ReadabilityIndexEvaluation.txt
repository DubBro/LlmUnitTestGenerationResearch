		"Test class follows the correct naming pattern 'CaesarEncoderTests' matching 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern throughout",
		"Excellent use of AAA pattern with clear '// Arrange', '// Act', '// Assert' comments and proper spacing",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests, avoiding duplication",
		"No extraneous comments beyond AAA separators, keeping tests clean and focused",
		"Consistent and clear variable naming (text, key, result, expected) that reflects purpose",
		"Good test coverage scenarios including edge cases (empty strings, negative keys, zero key, multiples of 26)",
		"Tests are well-structured with logical grouping of encode and decode tests",
		"Minor improvement possible: some Theory tests have empty '// Arrange' sections which could be omitted for cleaner look",
		"Overall excellent readability with professional structure and maintainability"
