	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the correct naming convention 'LUPDecompositionTests' matching the pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and proper spacing",
		"Test method names generally follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern with good clarity",
		"Consistent use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios without unnecessary duplication",
		"Code is well-formatted with proper indentation and spacing, making it easy to scan",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (matrix, L, U, P, result)",
		"One test combines Act and Assert ('Decompose_DegenerateMatrix_ThrowsInvalidOperationException') which slightly deviates from strict AAA separation",
		"No extraneous comments beyond AAA markers, maintaining clean code",
		"Good use of discard operator (_) for unused out parameters, showing modern C# awareness",
		"Could benefit from [Theory] with [InlineData] for similar structure validation tests (L, U, P output tests), but current approach is still readable"
