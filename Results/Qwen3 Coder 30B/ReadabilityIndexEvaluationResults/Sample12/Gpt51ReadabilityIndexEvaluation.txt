  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LUPDecompositionTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern and reflects the subject under test.",
    "Test method names follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and make the intent of each test obvious.",
    "AAA structure is consistently used and explicitly separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, improving scanability.",
    "Code formatting, indentation, and spacing are clean and consistent, making the tests easy to read.",
    "Variable naming within tests (`matrix`, `result`, `L`, `U`, `P`) is concise and domain-appropriate, supporting quick understanding.",
    "Each `[Fact]` addresses a single, well-defined scenario, keeping individual tests focused and small.",
    "Exception test uses `Assert.Throws` with a clear inline lambda, which is idiomatic and easy to follow.",
    "No extraneous comments or nested types are present, so the test file remains uncluttered.",
    "Some duplication of the same input matrix across multiple tests slightly reduces maintainability and could be improved via helpers or shared data.",
    "Magic numbers (like repeated dimension checks with `3`) appear in several tests; extracting them into named constants would further improve clarity."
