{"readabilityIndex": 65, "reasons": ["Good overall naming: test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern, test method names follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.", "AAA pattern implemented with clear Arrange, Act, Assert comments and proper separation.", "All tests are asynchronous and correctly use async Task signature.", "Tests are well-structured and generally easy to understand.", "Violation: multiple tests for similar scenarios (e.g., AddAsync with null model, null content, invalid userId) could be refactored using [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication.", "Violation: test names for AddAsync and UpdateAsync exception scenarios incorrectly reference NoteNotFoundException when testing null/empty inputs (likely should be ArgumentNullException or similar).", "Setup in constructor is clean and clear, using dependency injection patterns."]}
