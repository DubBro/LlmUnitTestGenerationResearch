  "reasons": [
    "Test class name NoteServiceTests clearly follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention and matches the SUT.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are very descriptive.",
    "All async tests correctly use async Task signatures and are easy to follow.",
    "AAA structure is applied consistently with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert (or // Act & Assert) comments and spacing.",
    "Shared setup is factored into the constructor using test doubles for IUnitOfWork and IRepository, reducing boilerplate and improving clarity.",
    "Naming of variables (noteModel, noteEntity, oldNoteEntity, userId, result) is clear and reflects their purpose.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or helper types; the test file structure is flat and straightforward.",
    "Some tests combine Act & Assert in one block, slightly blurring the AAA separation and reducing structural clarity.",
    "There is noticeable duplication in entity/model construction across tests, which could be extracted into helper methods/builders to improve maintainability.",
    "Use of magic values (e.g., 1, 2, specific titles and contents) is acceptable but could be made more explicit with constants to further enhance readability."
