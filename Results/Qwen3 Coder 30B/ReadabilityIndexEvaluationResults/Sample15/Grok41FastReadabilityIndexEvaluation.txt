		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names consistently follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Perfect adherence to AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and empty line separation.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple inputs, reducing some duplication.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names (input, result, expected).",
		"No unnecessary comments, nested classes, or deviations from C# naming conventions.",
		"Slight redundancy in separate [Fact]s for null/empty/whitespace before consolidating in [Theory], minor maintainability impact.",
		"Logical grouping of related tests for Encode and Decode methods."
