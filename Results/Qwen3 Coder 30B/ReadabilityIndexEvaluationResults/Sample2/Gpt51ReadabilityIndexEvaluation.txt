  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `EmployeeServiceTests` and method names largely follow the `ClassUnderTestTests` and `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` patterns, making intent easy to understand.",
    "AAA structure is consistently applied with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, which clearly separates test phases and improves scanability.",
    "Async tests correctly use `async Task` signatures and xUnit attributes (`[Fact]`), following standard conventions and reducing cognitive friction.",
    "Setup and use of NSubstitute mocks are straightforward and localized, keeping the interaction with `IEmployeeRepository` easy to follow.",
    "There is heavy duplication of `EmployeeEntity` and `EmployeeModel` construction with almost identical values across many tests, which hurts maintainability and makes tests visually noisy.",
    "Numerous validation tests differ only by a single invalid field but are implemented as separate `[Fact]`s instead of using `[Theory]` with data, creating avoidable repetition.",
    "Magic values such as IDs, dates, salaries, and strings are inlined repeatedly instead of being extracted to helper methods, builders, or constants, which reduces readability and increases change cost.",
    "In `ListFilteredAsync_WhenNoFiltersProvided_ReturnsAllEmployees`, the repository setup uses `ListAsync()` while the SUT calls `ListFilteredAsync`, introducing a small but confusing inconsistency in how similar scenarios are arranged.",
    "Some assertions (e.g., repeated `result.First()` calls) could be simplified with local variables, which would make the assert section more compact and readable."
