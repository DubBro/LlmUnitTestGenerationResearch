	"readabilityIndex": 58,
	"reasons": [
		"Test names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently, which is excellent",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comments and blank line separation throughout all tests",
		"Constructor-based dependency setup reduces duplication and follows good practices",
		"Async test methods correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Significant code duplication in EmployeeModel and EmployeeEntity object initialization across multiple tests (could use helper methods or object mother pattern)",
		"Multiple validation tests for AddAsync method test similar scenarios with nearly identical arrange blocks - should use [Theory] with [InlineData] to reduce duplication",
		"Excessive property assertions in GetAsync_WhenCalled_ReturnsEmployeeModel test (15 assertions) without clear grouping or explanation",
		"Missing [Theory] usage for testing different validation scenarios which leads to repetitive test code",
		"Named parameters in ListFilteredAsync calls improve clarity but the repeated null/0 default values add noise",
		"Overall structure is understandable but maintainability suffers from high duplication - refactoring to use test data builders or fixture methods would significantly improve readability"
