		"Test class and method names follow recommended conventions (ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult)",
		"Consistent AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and clear separation",
		"Proper use of async Task for asynchronous tests",
		"Concise exception tests using Assert.ThrowsAsync with combined Act & Assert",
		"Clear mocking setup in constructor, reused across tests",
		"High code duplication in repeated EmployeeEntity and EmployeeModel initializations across tests",
		"Verbose assertions listing every property individually, reducing scannability",
		"Missed opportunity for [Theory] and [InlineData] to parameterize similar validation tests and reduce duplication",
		"Lengthy Arrange and Assert sections due to boilerplate data setup",
		"Overall logical structure but maintenance hindered by repetition"
