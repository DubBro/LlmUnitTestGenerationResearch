		"Test class follows the correct naming pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test methods follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with comments and blank line separation in most tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] and [Theory] attributes with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout the tests",
		"Some tests combine 'Act & Assert' sections which slightly deviates from strict AAA separation",
		"Variable 'expectedParagraphCount' is declared but not used in some theory tests, creating minor confusion",
		"Inconsistent assertion logic in 'GenerateLoremIpsumHtmlSafe_ValidInputs_ReturnsHtmlStringWithCorrectParagraphCount' with redundant StringReader usage",
		"Overall good structure and maintainability with minor inconsistencies in assertion patterns",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, adhering to best practices"
