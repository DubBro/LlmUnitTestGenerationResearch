    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention and clearly indicates the subject under test (LoremIpsumGeneratorTests).",
    "Test method names are long but descriptive and consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent clear.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized cases is appropriate and reduces duplication.",
    "AAA structure is generally followed and visually separated with comments and blank lines, which improves scanability.",
    "Parameter names and local variable names are meaningful and consistent with .NET naming conventions.",
    "Assertion blocks are straightforward and mostly focused, making it easy to understand what is being verified.",
    "Some variables are declared but never used (e.g., expectedParagraphCount, openTags, closeTags), creating noise and slightly reducing clarity.",
    "Exception tests use a combined 'Act & Assert' style comment, which is common but slightly blurs strict AAA separation.",
    "The HTML paragraph count test name suggests counting paragraphs, but the implementation does not actually use the computed counts, which can confuse maintainers.",
    "Minor arrange duplication across tests could be refactored for better maintainability but does not seriously impact readability."
