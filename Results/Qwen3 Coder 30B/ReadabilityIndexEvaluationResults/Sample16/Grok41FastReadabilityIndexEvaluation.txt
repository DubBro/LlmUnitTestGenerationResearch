		"Strict adherence to AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and empty line separations.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple inputs, reducing duplication.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names and standard C# naming conventions.",
