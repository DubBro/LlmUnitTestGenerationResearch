		"Test class naming follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with proper comment separators and blank lines",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple input variations",
		"Variable naming is clear and meaningful throughout the tests",
		"Standard C# and .NET naming conventions are consistently applied",
		"Some redundancy exists with separate [Fact] tests that could be consolidated into [Theory] tests (e.g., null and empty string cases, ASCII-only cases)",
		"The test 'RemoveNonAsciiChars_InputContainsOnlyNonAsciiChars_ReplacesAllWithSpecifiedChar' has a misleading name mentioning 'Replaces' instead of 'Removes' for the RemoveNonAsciiChars method",
		"Minor inconsistency: one [Theory] test omits the Arrange section while all [Fact] tests include it, which slightly affects uniformity"
