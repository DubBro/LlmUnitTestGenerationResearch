    "Test class name `AsciiHelpersTests` clearly reflects the unit under test and follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are descriptive and unambiguous.",
    "AAA structure is clearly used and explicitly marked with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert`, greatly aiding scanability.",
    "Consistent formatting, spacing, and simple linear structure with no nested classes or helper constructs makes the file easy to follow.",
    "Appropriate use of `[Fact]` for single scenarios and `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple variations improves maintainability and reduces duplication for those cases.",
    "Some scenario overlap and minor duplication between individual `[Fact]` tests and the final `[Theory]` test slightly reduce maintainability and could be further consolidated."
