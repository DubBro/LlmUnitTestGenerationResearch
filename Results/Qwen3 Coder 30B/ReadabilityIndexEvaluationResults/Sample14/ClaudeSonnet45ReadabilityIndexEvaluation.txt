		"Test class follows the recommended naming pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Tests properly use AAA pattern with clear comment separators",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for testing multiple invalid inputs",
		"Test method names mostly follow the recommended pattern with clear scenarios and expected results",
		"Significant code duplication in assertion logic between the two [Fact] tests - the nested loops for comparing 2D arrays are repeated",
		"The first test could use a more specific exception type instead of generic 'Exception'",
		"Variable naming is clear and meaningful throughout the tests",
		"Test methods are well-structured and easy to understand despite the duplication",
		"Minor issue: 'GetRhombus_WithValidInput_ReturnsCorrectRhombus' could be more specific about size like the third test"
