		"Test class and method names follow recommended naming patterns: 'RhombusGeneratorTests', 'GetRhombus_WithInvalidInput_ThrowsException', 'GetRhombus_WithValidInput_ReturnsCorrectRhombus'.",
		"Tests follow the AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert blocks separated by comments and empty lines.",
		"Good use of Theory for parameterized testing of invalid inputs, avoiding code duplication.",
		"Test code is well-structured with clear variable names and logical flow.",
		"Consistent test structure across multiple test methods improves maintainability.",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or excessive comments cluttering the code.",
		"Proper use of xUnit attributes: [Theory] with [InlineData] and [Fact] for single scenarios.",
		"The only minor issue is that test names could be slightly more descriptive about the specific scenarios being tested."
