  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `RhombusGeneratorTests` clearly follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and matches the SUT.",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and clearly communicate the behavior under test.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently used and explicitly separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, which aids quick scanning and understanding.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for invalid inputs avoids duplication and makes input variations easy to see and extend.",
    "Code adheres to C# naming conventions; variable names like `expectedSize`, `expectedRhombus`, and `result` are meaningful and self-explanatory.",
    "Tests are short and focused on a single responsibility, with no unnecessary nesting or extra helpers that could obscure intent.",
    "Loop-based assertions are straightforward and uniform across tests, making the verification logic easy to follow.",
    "There is some duplication between the size 3 and size 5 tests (same size checks and nested loops) that could be refactored into a helper or a theory for better maintainability.",
    "Large inline 2D arrays for expected values, while explicit, can be visually dense and slightly harder to parse, and might benefit from extracted builders or named helpers.",
    "Exception assertion uses a very general `Exception` type; while readable, a more specific exception type or custom assertion helper could better communicate intent and improve long-term clarity."
