		"Excellent adherence to AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and logical separation.",
		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names mostly follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] and [InlineData] for multiple invalid inputs, avoiding duplication.",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names (e.g., expectedSize, expectedRhombus, result).",
		"Minor duplication in nested loop assertions between size 5 and size 3 tests, impacting maintainability.",
		"Vague scenario description in 'WithValidInput' test name; lacks specific size like the size 3 test.",
		"Verbose nested loops for multi-dimensional array comparisons slightly reduce readability."
