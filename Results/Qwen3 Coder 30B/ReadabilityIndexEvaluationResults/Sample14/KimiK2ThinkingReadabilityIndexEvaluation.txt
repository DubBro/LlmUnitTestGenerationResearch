		"Test class name follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern.",
		"All tests implement the AAA pattern with proper comments and spacing.",
		"Appropriate use of `[Theory]` for testing multiple invalid inputs.",
		"[Issue] Theory test data is ambiguous: unclear why inputs 2 and 4 are invalid.",
		"[Issue] Generic exception `Assert.Throws<Exception>()` should be more specific.",
		"[Issue] Significant code duplication: array comparison logic repeated across both valid input tests.",
		"[Issue] Test name contains vague terms: `WithValidInput` and `ReturnsCorrectRhombus` lack specificity.",
		"[Issue] Hardcoded 2D arrays are verbose and difficult to verify visually.",
		"No reusable helper method for 2D array equality assertions, harming maintainability."
