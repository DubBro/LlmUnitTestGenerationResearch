		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly applied in all tests with explicit comments separating Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for similar scenarios",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names that convey their purpose (node, result, expected)",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test methods enhances maintainability",
		"Good use of mocking framework (NSubstitute) with clear setup of test doubles",
		"Tests are well-organized, covering different edge cases systematically",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping tests clean and focused",
		"Minor improvement could be consolidating some Fact tests into Theory tests to further reduce duplication"
