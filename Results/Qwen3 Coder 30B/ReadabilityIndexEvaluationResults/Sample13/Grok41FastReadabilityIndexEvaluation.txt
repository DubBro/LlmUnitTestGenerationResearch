		"Consistent AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and separation.",
		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory]/[InlineData] for multiples, reducing duplication.",
		"No unnecessary comments, nested classes, or deviations from standard C# conventions.",
		"Arrange sections are simple and repetitive but readable with mocks.",
		"Most test names follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern effectively.",
		"Some test names use generic 'ReturnsExpectedResult' instead of specific outcomes, minor clarity issue.",
		"Scenario descriptions in names are clear and logical."
