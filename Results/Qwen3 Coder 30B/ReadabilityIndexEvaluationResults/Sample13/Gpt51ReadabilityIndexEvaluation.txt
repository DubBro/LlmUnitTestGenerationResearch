  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention and clearly indicates the subject under test (OntologyHelperTests).",
    "Test method names are mostly in the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and describe behavior in a readable, intention-revealing way.",
    "AAA structure is consistently followed and explicitly separated by // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments, making test flow easy to follow.",
    "Formatting is clean and consistent (spacing, braces, and line breaks), which improves scanability.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple input variations avoids duplication and keeps similar scenarios grouped.",
    "Mocking with NSubstitute is used in a straightforward way, with minimal setup noise and clear expectations.",
    "No extraneous comments or logic in tests; each test focuses on a single scenario and assertion, simplifying maintenance.",
    "Some test names use vague suffixes like ReturnsExpectedResult instead of describing the concrete expected outcome, slightly reducing clarity.",
    "There is noticeable duplication in arranging the INode substitute across tests; a small factory/helper could improve maintainability.",
    "A few scenario descriptions (e.g., WhenNoHashExists_ReturnsWholeString) are slightly misleading compared to the actual expectation, which can cause minor confusion for future readers."
