  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LotServiceTests` and namespace are clear and follow common conventions.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are descriptive.",
    "AAA pattern is clearly followed with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) comments and blank lines, making the flow easy to follow.",
    "Setup via constructor with `_databaseSubstitute`, `_mapperSubstitute`, and `_service` fields is straightforward and avoids duplication in tests.",
    "Use of NSubstitute and assertions like `Received(1)` and `Assert.Same` is consistent and readable.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested classes; code layout and formatting are clean and idiomatic C#.",
    "Some repetitive validation scenarios (e.g., null/invalid input for AddLot and UpdateLot) could be consolidated with `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]` to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
    "Minor redundancy and slightly over-detailed setup in a few tests (e.g., mapping nulls) may cause small cognitive overhead but do not seriously harm readability."
