		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, making test intent clear",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and empty lines between blocks",
		"No unnecessary comments outside of AAA block separators, keeping code clean",
		"Consistent use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios",
		"Field naming follows C# conventions with meaningful names (_databaseSubstitute, _mapperSubstitute, _service)",
		"Constructor-based test setup is clear and promotes reusability across tests",
		"Multiple similar validation tests (AddLot_LotWithNameNull, AddLot_LotWithOwnerNull, etc.) could be consolidated using [Theory] with [InlineData] to reduce code duplication",
		"Use of 'const' for immutable values improves code clarity and intent",
		"All test methods are synchronous which is appropriate for the scenarios being tested"
