		"Class and method names follow recommended patterns (ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult)",
		"Consistent AAA structure with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments (or Act & Assert for simple cases)",
		"Constructor handles shared setup of substitutes, avoiding repetition",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names and proper use of const/var",
		"No unnecessary comments, nested classes, or deviations from naming conventions",
		"Significant code duplication in validation tests (e.g., multiple AddLot/UpdateLot invalid cases), reducing maintainability",
		"Lack of [Theory] with [InlineData] for similar scenarios leads to repetitive code"
