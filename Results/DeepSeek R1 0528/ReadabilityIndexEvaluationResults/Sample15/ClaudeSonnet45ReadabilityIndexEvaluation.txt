		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern (Base64HelpersTests)",
		"Test method names clearly follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication across multiple input scenarios",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with clear comment markers (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert)",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (input, expected, result)",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping the code clean",
		"Standard C# naming conventions are consistently followed throughout",
		"Good test coverage structure with separate tests for edge cases, valid inputs, and error scenarios",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: some Arrange blocks are empty but still marked with comments, which is acceptable but could be omitted",
		"Excellent overall readability and maintainability with logical grouping of related test scenarios"
