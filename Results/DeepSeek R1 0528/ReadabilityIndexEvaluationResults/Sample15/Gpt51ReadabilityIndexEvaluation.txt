    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (Base64HelpersTests).",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and accurately describe behavior.",
    "Consistent use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to cover multiple input variations avoids duplication and improves clarity.",
    "AAA pattern is followed in each test, with clear separation (even if Arrange is sometimes empty), making test flow easy to follow.",
    "Code formatting (spacing, line breaks, indentation) is clean and consistent, aiding quick visual parsing.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or complex structures; one flat test class keeps the file easy to navigate.",
    "Use of extension methods Encode/Decode is clear in context and keeps the Act step readable.",
    "Input and expected values in InlineData are small and self-explanatory, making scenarios easy to understand at a glance.",
    "Correct use of void-return tests and Assert.Throws in a single Act & Assert block preserves readability.",
    "Minor deviation from guidelines (an inline comment in InlineData and using [Theory] instead of [Fact] for the single invalid-case scenario) slightly reduces, but does not significantly harm, overall readability."
