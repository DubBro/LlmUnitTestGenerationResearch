  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LuTests` clearly reflects the class under test and follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention.",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern, making intent easy to understand.",
    "AAA structure is consistently applied with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments (or `// Act & Assert` where appropriate), clearly separating test phases.",
    "Variable names like `matrix`, `coefficients`, `expectedSolution`, and `nonSquareMatrix` are meaningful and self-explanatory.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested classes; test bodies are short and focused on a single scenario each.",
    "Consistent formatting and spacing improve visual scanning and comprehension.",
    "Use of shared `_lu` field for the system under test avoids duplication while keeping tests straightforward.",
    "Assertions are simple and explicit, though element-wise comparisons for matrices are slightly verbose.",
    "Similar scenarios (e.g., multiple `Eliminate` success cases) could benefit from `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` or helper methods to reduce minor duplication.",
    "Some assertion blocks for matrices could be made more readable with helper methods or custom assertions to express intent at a higher level."
