 {"readabilityIndex":72,"reasons":["Code duplication in Decompose_2x2Matrix_CorrectDecomposition: element-by-element assertions are verbose and unmaintainable; a helper method for matrix equality would significantly improve readability","Test names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making test purposes clear","AAA pattern is correctly applied with clear comments and separation in all test methods","Variable names are meaningful and accurately describe the test data and expected results","Appropriate use of [Fact] attribute for single scenarios without unnecessary parameterization","The precision parameter '5' in Assert.Equal is a magic number that reduces clarity; a named constant or comment would improve understanding"]}
