	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the proper naming convention 'ClassUnderTestTests' (LuTests)",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly followed with appropriate comments (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert)",
		"Tests are well-structured and logically separated by empty lines between AAA blocks",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
		"Meaningful variable names that clearly describe their purpose (nonSquareMatrix, expectedSolution, coefficients)",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: repetitive assertions in matrix comparison tests could use helper methods or assertion libraries for better maintainability",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: shared instance field '_lu' could be recreated per test to ensure isolation, though acceptable for stateless services"
