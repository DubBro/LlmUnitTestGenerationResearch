		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication across similar test cases",
		"Clear AAA pattern implementation with proper comment separators in all tests",
		"Meaningful variable names (input, expected, result, node) that clearly convey their purpose",
		"Good separation of logical blocks with empty lines improving visual structure",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions throughout",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
		"Well-organized test data in InlineData attributes demonstrating various edge cases",
		"Minor improvement possible: 'Act & Assert' comment in one test slightly deviates from standard AAA separation, but justified for exception testing"
