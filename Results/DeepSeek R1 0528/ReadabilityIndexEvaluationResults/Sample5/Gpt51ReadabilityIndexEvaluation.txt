  "readabilityIndex": 92,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `FolderServiceTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention.",
    "Test method names follow the `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and clearly express intent.",
    "Consistent use of async `Task` signatures for asynchronous tests; no `async void` usage.",
    "AAA structure is followed and visually separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) making flow easy to follow.",
    "Variable, field, and parameter names are meaningful and self-explanatory, matching C# naming conventions.",
    "Use of `[Fact]` for single scenarios and `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for parameterized cases is appropriate and reduces duplication.",
    "Assertions are clear and localized; use of `Assert.Collection` improves readability of collection expectations.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments; file is structurally simple and easy to navigate.",
    "Some setup code for folder entities is duplicated across tests, which slightly impacts maintainability and could be improved with helper methods or builders.",
    "A few minor inconsistencies in AAA comment wording (e.g., `// Act & Assert`) and slightly verbose `Task.FromResult` usage add small visual noise but do not significantly harm readability."
