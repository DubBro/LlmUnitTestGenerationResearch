		"Test class naming follows 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern (FolderServiceTests).",
		"Test method names follow 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, clearly communicating purpose.",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied with explicit comments for Arrange, Act, Assert blocks.",
		"Asynchronous tests correctly use 'async Task' return type.",
		"Proper use of [Fact] and [Theory] attributes to avoid code duplication for validation scenarios.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable and field names enhance understanding.",
		"Good separation of test scenarios with logical flow and minimal nesting.",
		"Assertions are explicit and readable, though some could be simplified with helper assertions for collections.",
		"Minor improvement: some test data setup is verbose; could use test data builders for complex entities.",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions throughout."
