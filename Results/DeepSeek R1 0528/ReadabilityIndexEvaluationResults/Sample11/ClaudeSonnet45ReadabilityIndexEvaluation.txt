	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the standard naming pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All tests properly implement the AAA pattern with clear comment separators and blank lines",
		"Test method names generally follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (p, n, cost, s, result, parentheses)",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout all tests",
		"Good use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios",
		"Some test names are verbose and could be more concise (e.g., 'MatrixChainOrder_ThreeMatrices_Returns7500AndSetsSCorrectly' combines multiple assertions)",
		"Minor inconsistency: some tests verify implementation details (checking s array dimensions and values) which slightly reduces focus on behavior",
		"No code duplication; each test is self-contained with its own setup",
		"Tests lack [Theory] with [InlineData] where parameterization could reduce repetition for similar scenarios"
