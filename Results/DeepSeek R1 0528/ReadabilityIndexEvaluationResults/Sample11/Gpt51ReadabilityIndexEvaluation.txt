  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names mostly follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and clearly express intent and expected outcome.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently used and explicitly marked with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert, improving structure and scan-ability.",
    "Formatting is clean and consistent (spacing, line breaks, indentation), making individual tests easy to read.",
    "Each test covers a single scenario, and assertions are logically grouped, aiding quick understanding of what is being verified.",
    "Use of plain types and simple arrangements (arrays and matrices) keeps each test body relatively short and understandable.",
    "No extraneous comments or nested classes; the file is focused on test logic only, which improves maintainability.",
    "Combined methods tests at the bottom are clearly named and show higher-level behavior, complementing the lower-level tests.",
    "Variable names like p, n, and s are terse and not self-explanatory, slightly reducing readability compared to more descriptive names (e.g., dimensions, length, splitIndices).",
    "Some duplication in Arrange steps (repeated setups for the same scenarios) could be extracted into helper methods or test data to improve maintainability further."
