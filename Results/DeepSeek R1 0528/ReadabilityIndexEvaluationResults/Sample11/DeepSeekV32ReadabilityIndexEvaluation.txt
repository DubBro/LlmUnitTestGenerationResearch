{"readabilityIndex": 85,"reasons": ["Test class name follows the correct pattern: MatrixChainMultiplicationTests.","Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.","All tests clearly follow the AAA pattern with explicit comments for Arrange, Act, Assert blocks.","No unnecessary nested classes present.","Good use of [Fact] attribute for single scenarios.","Variable names are clear and meaningful (e.g., p for matrix dimensions, n for count, s for split matrix).","Tests are well-structured with logical separation and clear formatting.","No asynchronous methods present, so no issues with async signatures.","All test methods are focused on a single responsibility and scenario.","Some minor duplication in arranging s matrices could be improved, but overall structure is very readable."]}
