    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (AuctionServiceTests).",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent immediately clear.",
    "AAA structure is used throughout, with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments (or combined Act & Assert) and appropriate spacing, which makes test flow easy to follow.",
    "Field, variable, and parameter names are meaningful and self-explanatory (e.g., invalidId, expectedDto, startedAuction), aiding quick comprehension.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments; the file structure is flat and focused solely on unit tests.",
    "Use of NSubstitute and mocking patterns is consistent and straightforward, with minimal noise in Arrange sections.",
    "Constructor-based setup of shared dependencies (_service, _database, _auctionRepository, _mapper) avoids repeated boilerplate and keeps individual tests focused on behavior.",
    "Error message assertions are explicit and readable, making the expected failure modes clear, although magic strings are repeated in several places.",
    "There is notable repetition across tests with very similar setups (e.g., invalid id, auction not found) that could be reduced via [Theory]/[InlineData] or helper methods to further improve maintainability.",
    "The test class is relatively large and could be logically grouped (e.g., by method region: GetAuction, OpenAuction, CloseAuction, Bet) or split into multiple classes for even better navigability."
