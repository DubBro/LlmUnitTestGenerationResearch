		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, making intent immediately clear",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied across all tests with proper comment separators and blank line spacing",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping tests clean and focused",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (e.g., 'invalidId', 'expectedDto', 'startedAuction')",
		"Constructor setup for shared dependencies is clean and well-organized using NSubstitute",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout all test methods",
		"Good use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios, though some tests could potentially be combined using [Theory] for similar validation scenarios (e.g., multiple InvalidIdException tests)",
		"Exception message assertions are included where appropriate, adding valuable verification",
		"No nested classes or unnecessary complexity, maintaining flat and straightforward test structure"
