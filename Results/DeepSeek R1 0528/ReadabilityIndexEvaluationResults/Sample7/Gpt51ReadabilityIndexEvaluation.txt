  "reasons": [
    "Clear, descriptive class and test method names that follow the ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns.",
    "Consistent use of async Task signatures and xUnit attributes ([Fact] for single scenarios, [Theory] with [InlineData] for variants).",
    "Tests generally follow the AAA pattern with explicit Arrange/Act/Assert separation and good whitespace formatting.",
    "Assertions are focused and readable, using Assert.Collection and simple equality checks that clearly express expectations.",
    "Use of NSubstitute is straightforward, with mocks created in the constructor and reused, improving clarity and reducing setup noise.",
    "Some duplication of IMEI test data between theories and repeated magic strings slightly reduces maintainability but does not significantly harm readability."
