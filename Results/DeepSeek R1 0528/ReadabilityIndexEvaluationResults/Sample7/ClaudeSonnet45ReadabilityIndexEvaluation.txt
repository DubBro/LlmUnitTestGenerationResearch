		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern, making it immediately clear what is being tested",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently, providing clear documentation of test intent",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with clear comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and logical grouping",
		"Effective use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to test multiple invalid input variations without code duplication",
		"Constructor properly initializes shared test dependencies, following DRY principle and improving maintainability",
		"Asynchronous tests correctly use 'async Task' signatures instead of 'async void'",
		"Field and variable naming is clear and meaningful (_walkRepositorySubstitute, validImei, entities, result)",
		"Test code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and appropriate use of whitespace for readability",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators; code is self-documenting through descriptive naming",
		"Tests are logically organized and easy to understand, with each test having a single, clear responsibility"
