		"Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (WalkServiceTests)",
		"Test names follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Tests follow AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert sections separated by comments and empty lines",
		"Proper use of Theory attribute with InlineData for parameterized tests to avoid code duplication",
		"Tests use async Task signatures instead of async void",
		"Meaningful variable and method names that clearly indicate their purpose",
		"No unnecessary nested classes in the test class",
		"Good separation of concerns with setup in constructor and clear test scenarios",
		"Minor issue: Could benefit from more descriptive comments about test scenarios in the test names",
		"Assertions are clear but some could be more expressive (e.g., using fluent assertions)"
