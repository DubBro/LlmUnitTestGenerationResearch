		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests convention.",
		"Test method names adhere to MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Effective use of [Theory] and [InlineData] to test multiple invalid inputs without duplication.",
		"Consistent async Task signatures for asynchronous tests.",
		"Mostly follows AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments for clear separation.",
		"Clear and meaningful names for variables, fields, and parameters.",
		"Minor flaw: extraneous explanatory comments next to [InlineData] values.",
		"Minor flaw: Act and Assert combined in invalid input tests, deviating from strict AAA blocks.",
		"Nested lambdas in Assert.Collection are readable but could use more descriptive parameter names."
