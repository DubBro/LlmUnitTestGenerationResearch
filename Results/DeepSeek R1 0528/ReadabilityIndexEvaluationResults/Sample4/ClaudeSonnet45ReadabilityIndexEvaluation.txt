		"Test class follows the recommended naming pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comment markers and appropriate spacing",
		"Asynchronous tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication when testing multiple inputs",
		"Field naming follows standard C# conventions with readonly modifier and underscore prefix for private fields",
		"Constructor setup is clean and centralizes dependency initialization using NSubstitute",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping the code clean and focused",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout all test methods",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: some tests could benefit from more descriptive variable names like 'nonExistentId' instead of magic number 999"
