  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `RhombusGeneratorTests` clearly follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and reflects its purpose.",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult convention, making intent immediately clear.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently applied and visually separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments and blank lines, improving scanability.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for invalid inputs avoids duplication and groups related scenarios logically.",
    "Variable names (`size`, `expectedArray`, `result`, `act`) are concise yet descriptive, aiding quick understanding.",
    "Array literals for expected results are clearly formatted in a matrix-like layout, making the intended rhombus shapes easy to visualize.",
    "The helper method `AssertArrayEqual` encapsulates repeated comparison logic, improving maintainability and keeping test bodies focused on behavior.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested classes; the structure is flat and straightforward.",
    "Consistent C# naming conventions and code style (braces, spacing, indentation) enhance overall readability.",
    "Minor potential improvement: repeated size-specific tests could be refactored into data-driven tests (e.g., using `MemberData`) to centralize expected data, but this is not critical."
