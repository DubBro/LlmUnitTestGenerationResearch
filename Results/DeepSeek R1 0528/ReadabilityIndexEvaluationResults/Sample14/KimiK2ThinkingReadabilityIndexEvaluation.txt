		"Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern",
		"Test method names use the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult format",
		"AAA pattern is correctly implemented with clear block comments and separation",
		"Code duplication: three nearly identical tests (Size1, Size3, Size5) should be combined into a Theory",
		"Theory test mixes invalid inputs poorly: cases 2 and 4 don't clearly match the 'InvalidInput' scenario name",
		"Helper method AssertArrayEqual is extracted but could be static and provide better error messages",
		"Follows standard C# naming conventions for all identifiers",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers",
		"No nested classes used",
		"Properly uses xUnit attributes [Theory] and [Fact] for test scenarios"
