	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"AAA pattern is clearly followed with comment separators in most tests",
		"Consistent and meaningful naming for variables (_repositorySubstitute, _sut, testId, mockEntity)",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
		"Good use of constructor for test setup, reducing duplication across tests",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: 'GetAsync_WhenRepositoryReturnsNull_ThrowsNullReferenceException' combines Act & Assert, deviating slightly from strict AAA separation",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: Loop-based assertions in 'ListAsync_WhenRepositoryReturnsNonEmptyList_ReturnsMappedCollection' could be replaced with individual assertions or collection assertion helpers for better readability",
		"Overall structure is logical, well-formatted, and easy to maintain with only minor deviations from the ideal"
