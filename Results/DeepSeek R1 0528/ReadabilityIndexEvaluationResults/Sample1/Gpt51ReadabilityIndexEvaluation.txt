  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (`DepartmentServiceTests`) and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent and behavior easy to understand.",
    "All async tests correctly use `async Task` signatures, avoiding `async void` and improving clarity and reliability.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently used and visually separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, improving structure and scanability.",
    "Dependencies are clearly expressed via private readonly fields (`_repositorySubstitute`, `_sut`) and initialized in the constructor, making setup straightforward.",
    "Assertions are explicit and directly related to arranged data, making it easy to see what each test verifies (e.g., mapping of properties).",
    "Use of NSubstitute is clear and localized in Arrange sections, with simple `Returns` setups that are easy to follow.",
    "Collection test setup and verification are straightforward, though the `for` + `ElementAt` pattern is slightly more verbose than necessary for readability.",
    "\"Act & Assert\" combined comment in one test slightly deviates from the ideal AAA separation, but the structure is still understandable.",
    "Minor opportunities for simplification (e.g., `Returns(mockEntity)` instead of `Task.FromResult`, using collection assertion helpers) keep it just short of perfect readability."
