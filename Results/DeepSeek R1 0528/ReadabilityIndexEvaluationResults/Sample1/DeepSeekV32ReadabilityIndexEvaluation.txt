		"Good adherence to the AAA pattern with clear comments separating Arrange, Act, Assert blocks",
		"Test names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making purpose clear",
		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern (DepartmentServiceTests)",
		"Proper use of async Task signatures for asynchronous test methods",
		"Setup in constructor isolates test dependencies cleanly",
		"Clear use of mocking framework (NSubstitute) with readable stubs",
		"Assertions are straightforward but could be improved with assertion frameworks for better readability",
		"Some tests could benefit from [Theory] with [InlineData] to reduce duplication (e.g., GetAsync tests)",
		"For loop in ListAsync_WhenRepositoryReturnsNonEmptyList_ReturnsMappedCollection reduces readability compared to single assertion",
		"Missing test cases for edge scenarios and null/empty strings in data"
