  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LUPDecompositionTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and makes the subject under test obvious",
    "Test method names are descriptive, mostly follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern, and make it easy to understand each scenario (e.g., `Decompose_SingularMatrix_ThrowsInvalidOperationException`)",
    "AAA structure is consistently present and explicitly separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`), which improves scanability",
    "Helper methods like `AssertMatricesEqual`, `ApplyPermutation`, and `MultiplyMatrices` encapsulate repeated logic and keep individual tests focused and short",
    "Variable naming is clear and domain-appropriate (`original`, `input`, `expectedL`, `expectedU`, `P`), avoiding ambiguity",
    "Formatting and indentation are clean and consistent, with well-aligned multi-line matrices that are easy to visually parse",
    "Tests are cohesive, each covering a single scenario, and the mixing of Arrange/Act/Assert inside lambda for exception tests is minimal and still readable",
    "No distracting or obsolete comments beyond AAA separators; the code is free from noise and commented-out blocks",
    "Use of strongly typed arrays and explicit expected values for matrices and strings makes the intent of each assertion obvious",
    "Minor inconsistencies (e.g., using specific values like `Permutation210` in names instead of more generic scenario descriptions, and not leveraging `[Theory]` for similar matrix/permutation tests) slightly reduce ideal parameterization and naming uniformity but do not significantly harm readability"
