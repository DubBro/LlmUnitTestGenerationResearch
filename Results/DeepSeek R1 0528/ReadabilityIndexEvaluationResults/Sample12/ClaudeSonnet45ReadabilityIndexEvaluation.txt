		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'LUPDecompositionTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators",
		"Helper methods (AssertMatricesEqual, ApplyPermutation, MultiplyMatrices) improve code reuse and reduce duplication",
		"Variable and method names are clear and meaningful throughout",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or code comments beyond AAA separators",
		"Tests are well-structured and logically organized",
		"Minor issue: 'Act & Assert' combined in exception tests could be separated for stricter AAA adherence",
		"Overall very good readability with minimal maintenance concerns"
