	"reasons": [
		"Test names clearly follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Consistent AAA pattern with comments and spacing throughout all tests",
		"Well-structured helper methods (AssertMatricesEqual, ApplyPermutation, MultiplyMatrices) reduce code duplication",
		"Clean and readable test data definitions with proper formatting",
		"Follows standard C# naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables",
		"Appropriate use of xUnit assertions including custom precision for floating-point comparisons",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes - only Arrange/Act/Assert separators",
		"Helper methods could be static for better clarity since they don't use instance state",
		"Minor inconsistency: some tests specify precision=5 while others use default parameter value",
		"Overall logical structure making tests easy to understand and maintain"
