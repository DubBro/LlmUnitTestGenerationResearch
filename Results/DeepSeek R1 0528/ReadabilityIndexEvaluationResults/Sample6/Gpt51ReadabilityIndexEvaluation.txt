  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and field names are clear and domain‑specific (e.g., LotServiceTests, _lotRepositorySubstitute), making roles and dependencies easy to understand.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and accurately describe behavior (e.g., AddLot_LotIsNull_ThrowsInvalidLotException).",
    "Tests are short, focused on single scenarios, and strongly structured around the AAA pattern with clear separation by comments in most cases.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for invalid id cases avoids duplication and improves readability for parameterized scenarios.",
    "Consistent use of Arrange/Act/Assert comments and blank lines yields visually scannable tests that are easy to navigate.",
    "Mock/stub setup via NSubstitute is straightforward and consistently written, so the intent of each interaction (Get, Add, Update, Commit) is easy to follow.",
    "Naming of DTOs and entities (lotDto, lot, expectedDtos) is consistent and descriptive, making the mapping and returned values clear.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or helper constructs; the file has a simple, flat structure that is easy to maintain.",
    "There is some minor duplication in Arrange sections (e.g., repeated list and mapper setup patterns) that could be refactored into helpers to further improve maintainability.",
    "A few tests combine Act and Assert with '// Act & Assert' instead of three explicit AAA sections, which is understandable but slightly reduces structural uniformity."
