		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, making the purpose of each test immediately clear",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and appropriate spacing",
		"Excellent use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to eliminate code duplication for testing multiple invalid ID scenarios",
		"Field and variable naming is clear and follows C# conventions with meaningful names like '_lotRepositorySubstitute' and 'expectedDto'",
		"Constructor setup is well-organized and establishes all necessary test dependencies in a logical manner",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA pattern separators, keeping tests clean and focused",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test methods makes the test suite easy to navigate and maintain",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: some validation tests for AddLot and UpdateLot could potentially be consolidated using [Theory] to further reduce duplication",
		"Overall excellent readability with clear intent, logical organization, and adherence to testing best practices"
