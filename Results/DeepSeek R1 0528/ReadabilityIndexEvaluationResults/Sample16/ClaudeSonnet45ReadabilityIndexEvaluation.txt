		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern effectively",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication across multiple test cases",
		"Clear and meaningful parameter names (input, replacement, expected) that communicate intent",
		"Tests follow AAA pattern with Act and Assert blocks clearly marked with comments",
		"Missing Arrange block comments, though arrangement is minimal in these tests",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments cluttering the code",
		"Standard C# naming conventions are consistently applied throughout",
		"Good test coverage of edge cases (null, empty, whitespace, various non-ASCII characters) demonstrating thoughtful test design",
		"Minor improvement possible: empty line separation between AAA blocks would enhance visual structure"
