  "readabilityIndex": 92,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `AsciiHelpersTests` clearly follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and communicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are descriptive enough to understand the intent of each test.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` is appropriate for multiple input variations and effectively avoids code duplication.",
    "Parameter names (`input`, `replacement`, `expected`) are clear and self-explanatory, aiding quick comprehension of each test case.",
    "AAA structure is present and explicitly separated by `// Act` and `// Assert` comments, making the flow of each test easy to follow.",
    "Formatting and indentation are consistent, with no unnecessary whitespace or clutter, contributing to straightforward readability.",
    "No extraneous comments or nested classes are present, keeping the tests focused and easy to scan.",
    "All tests are synchronous methods returning `void` for non-async code, which is correct and keeps signatures simple.",
    "Inline test data is well-chosen and small enough to be readable in-place, demonstrating diverse scenarios without becoming noisy.",
    "Minor improvement area: the scenario part of method names is somewhat generic (e.g., `GivenVariousInputs`) and could be slightly more specific, but this does not significantly hurt readability."
