		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'LoremIpsumGeneratorTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly applied with proper comments and spacing in most tests",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication in paragraph count test",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful throughout",
		"Some code duplication exists across multiple tests with identical Arrange blocks (minWords, maxWords, minSentences, maxSentences, numParagraphs)",
		"The assertion logic in 'GenerateLoremIpsumString_SentenceEndsWithDotSpace' test appears flawed but affects correctness, not readability",
		"Combined 'Act & Assert' sections in exception tests are acceptable but break strict AAA separation",
		"Static readonly field 'ExpectedWords' is well-named and appropriately scoped",
		"Overall structure is logical, maintainable, and easy to understand despite minor duplication issues"
