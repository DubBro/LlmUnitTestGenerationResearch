		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern effectively.",
		"Consistent use of AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for variations.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names and adherence to C# naming conventions.",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
		"Significant code duplication in Arrange and Act sections across multiple tests, harming maintainability.",
		"Overlapping assertions (e.g., words from dictionary checked in multiple tests).",
		"Combined Act & Assert in exception-throwing tests deviates slightly from strict AAA.",
		"Repetitive parameter setup could be centralized or parameterized further."
