  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LoremIpsumGeneratorTests` clearly follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and matches the SUT.",
    "Test method names mostly follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are descriptive enough to understand intent.",
    "AAA structure is consistently used with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, making the flow easy to follow.",
    "Naming of local variables (`minWords`, `maxWords`, `minSentences`, etc.) is clear and self-explanatory, aiding quick comprehension.",
    "Use of a shared `ExpectedWords` array at the top reduces duplication and centralizes test data, improving maintainability.",
    "Correct use of `[Fact]` for single scenarios and `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for parameterized cases improves structure and avoids duplication in those scenarios.",
    "Consistent C# naming conventions and formatting (spacing, indentation) contribute to overall readability.",
    "Some repeated Arrange blocks with identical parameter values across multiple tests introduce unnecessary duplication and could be refactored into helpers or test data builders.",
    "Two tests for `GenerateLoremIpsumString` that both effectively verify dictionary words introduce conceptual duplication and slightly obscure distinct test intent.",
    "Certain test names (e.g., `ReturnsValidStructure`) suggest broader structural checks than are actually implemented, causing a mild mismatch between name and assertions."
