  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Individual test names follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult style, making purpose and behavior easy to understand.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently followed and visually separated with comments, improving quick scanning and comprehension.",
    "Variable names (array, expected, original, shuffler) are clear and domain-appropriate, avoiding ambiguity.",
    "Use of [Fact] vs [Theory] with [InlineData] is appropriate, reducing duplication and grouping related scenarios logically.",
    "Test methods are short, focused on a single behavior, and free from unnecessary logic, which aids maintainability.",
    "No extraneous comments beyond Arrange/Act/Assert and no nested test classes, keeping the structure clean.",
    "Assertions are straightforward and placed at the end of tests, respecting the expected flow and aiding readability.",
    "The combined Act & Assert in the exception test is slightly inconsistent with the AAA separation used elsewhere, marginally reducing uniformity.",
    "InlineData arrays are somewhat verbose and dense in the attribute list, which can slightly hinder quick visual parsing."
