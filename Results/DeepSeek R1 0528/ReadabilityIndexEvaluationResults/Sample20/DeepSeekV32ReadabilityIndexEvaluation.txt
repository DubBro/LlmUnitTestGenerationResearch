		"Clear test class name following the 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern.",
		"Meaningful test names following the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern.",
		"Tests follow the AAA pattern with clear comments marking each section.",
		"Good separation of blocks with empty lines and consistent formatting.",
		"Uses both [Fact] and [Theory] appropriately to avoid code duplication for multiple scenarios.",
		"Variable names are descriptive and reflect their purpose.",
		"All tests are synchronous and follow proper method signatures (no async void).",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or complex structures.",
		"Minor issue: The test for null array is testing behavior that likely should throw ArgumentNullException rather than NullReferenceException (though this doesn't affect readability).",
		"Test methods are focused and each validates a specific scenario."
