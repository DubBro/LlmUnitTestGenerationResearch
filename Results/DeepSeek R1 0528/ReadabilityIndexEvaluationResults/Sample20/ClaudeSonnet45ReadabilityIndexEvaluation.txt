		"Test class name follows the correct pattern: FisherYatesShufflerTests",
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with comment separators in most tests",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication in the Shuffle_AnyArray_PreservesElements test",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (array, expected, shuffler, original)",
		"One test combines Act and Assert blocks (Shuffle_ArrayIsNull_ThrowsNullReferenceException), which deviates from strict AAA separation",
		"Code adheres to C# and .NET naming conventions throughout",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA block separators, keeping tests clean",
		"The test for null array uses async void pattern correctly (it's synchronous, so no async needed)",
		"Minor inconsistency: variable 'shuffledSorted' in the last test could have a more descriptive name like 'sortedShuffled' for better clarity"
