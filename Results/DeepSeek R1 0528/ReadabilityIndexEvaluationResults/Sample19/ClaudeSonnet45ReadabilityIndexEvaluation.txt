		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication across multiple input scenarios",
		"AAA pattern blocks are marked with comments and separated, though Arrange blocks are empty in all tests",
		"Clear and comprehensive test data coverage with edge cases (null, empty, whitespace) included",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test methods",
		"Variable names (input, expected, result) are clear and meaningful",
		"Minor issue: empty Arrange sections could be omitted when no setup is needed, reducing visual clutter",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or extraneous comments beyond AAA markers",
		"All tests are synchronous which is appropriate for the methods under test"
