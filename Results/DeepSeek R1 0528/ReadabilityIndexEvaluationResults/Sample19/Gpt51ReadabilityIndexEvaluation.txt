  "readabilityIndex": 94,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `StringExtensionsTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and reflects the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern, making intent immediately understandable.",
    "All tests use `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` appropriately to cover multiple input variations without code duplication.",
    "AAA pattern is followed in every test with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments and clean separation of sections.",
    "Code formatting is consistent (indentation, spacing, ordering of attributes) and there are no distracting or redundant comments.",
    "Each test has a single, simple assertion, which improves clarity and makes failures easier to interpret.",
    "Minor nit: parameters that accept `null` values could be explicitly annotated as nullable (`string?`) for slightly clearer intent, but this does not significantly impact readability."
