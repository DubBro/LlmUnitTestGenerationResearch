  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `CaesarEncoderTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and matches the SUT.",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow a consistent `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult`-style pattern, making intent immediately clear.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple input cases avoids duplication and keeps parameterized scenarios compact and readable.",
    "AAA structure is consistently followed, with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) separators improving logical flow.",
    "Code formatting is clean and consistent: proper spacing, line breaks, and simple, small test methods aid quick scanning and comprehension.",
    "Variable names like `input`, `key`, `expected`, `original`, `encoded`, and `decoded` are meaningful and self-explanatory.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or complex fixtures; the test class is flat and focused on the CaesarEncoder behavior.",
    "Synchronous/asynchronous signatures are appropriate (all synchronous here), avoiding confusion about execution model.",
    "Additional inline comments explaining modular arithmetic, while slightly verbose relative to the ideal (AAA-only comments), still aid understanding of edge case intent.",
    "Minor inconsistencies like using `// Act & Assert` instead of separate blocks and extra explanatory comments prevent this from being perfectly minimal, but they do not significantly harm readability."
