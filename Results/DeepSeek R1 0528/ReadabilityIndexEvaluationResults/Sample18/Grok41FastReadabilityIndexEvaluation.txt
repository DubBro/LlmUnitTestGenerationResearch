		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names consistently follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Strict adherence to AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and proper separation.",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests, avoiding duplication.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names and standard C# naming conventions.",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all tests.",
		"Minor flaw: extraneous explanatory comments in Arrange sections of some tests (e.g., math explanations).",
		"Minor flaw: combined // Act & Assert in exception tests, slightly deviating from pure separation."
