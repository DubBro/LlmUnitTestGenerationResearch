        "Clear test class naming following 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
        "Descriptive test method names using 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
        "Consistent AAA pattern with explicit Arrange, Act, Assert comments",
        "Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests to avoid duplication",
        "Proper formatting with clear separation between test sections",
        "Meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose",
        "All test methods follow async Task pattern correctly (though not needed for these synchronous tests)",
        "Tests are logically organized and easy to understand",
        "No unnecessary nested classes or complexity",
        "Minor issue: Some tests combine Arrange & Act sections, but this is acceptable for simple scenarios"
