  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (VectorExtensionsTests), clearly indicating the unit under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent and behavior easy to understand.",
    "AAA pattern is followed throughout, with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert (or combined // Arrange & Act) comments and visual separation between phases.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests is correct and avoids duplication, improving maintainability.",
    "Naming of local variables (lhs, rhs, vector, expected, result) is concise yet unambiguous in the mathematical context.",
    "Code is cleanly formatted with consistent spacing, no extraneous comments, and no unnecessary nesting, which aids quick scanning.",
    "All tests are synchronous where appropriate and use proper Task-less signatures (no async misuse), matching the behavior under test.",
    "Matrix-related assertions sometimes rely on manual GetLength checks and nested loops instead of small helper methods or centralized assertions, which slightly reduces readability and increases duplication.",
    "There is minor inconsistency in assertion style for multidimensional arrays (sometimes value-by-value loops, sometimes just shape checks), which can slow comprehension when browsing related tests."
