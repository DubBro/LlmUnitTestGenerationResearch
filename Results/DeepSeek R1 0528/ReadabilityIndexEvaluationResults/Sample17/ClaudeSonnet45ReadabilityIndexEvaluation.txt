		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with appropriate comment separators in most tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests",
		"Variable names are clear, meaningful, and reflect their purpose (e.g., 'expected', 'result', 'lhs', 'rhs')",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
		"Proper use of empty line separation between AAA blocks enhances readability",
		"Minor inconsistency: some Theory tests use 'Arrange & Act' combined comment which slightly deviates from strict AAA separation",
		"Good test coverage structure with edge cases (empty vectors, invalid inputs) clearly named and organized",
		"Code adheres to standard C# and .NET naming conventions throughout"
