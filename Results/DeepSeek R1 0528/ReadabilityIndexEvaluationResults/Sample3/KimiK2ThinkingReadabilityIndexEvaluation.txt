	"reasons": [
		"Test class and method names follow clear, consistent patterns (ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult)",
		"All tests properly implement the AAA pattern with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and block separation",
		"Correct use of [Fact] and [Theory] attributes for single and parameterized test scenarios",
		"Asynchronous tests correctly return Task instead of void",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes; private fields follow C# naming conventions",
		"Some object initializers span very long lines, reducing horizontal scanability",
		"Complex lambda expressions in Arg.Is() predicates require careful reading, slightly impacting immediate comprehension",
		"Minor inconsistency: one test lacks blank line separation after the Arrange block",
		"Repetitive transaction verification patterns across tests slightly affect maintainability",
		"Overall excellent structure with clear naming makes test purposes immediately understandable"
