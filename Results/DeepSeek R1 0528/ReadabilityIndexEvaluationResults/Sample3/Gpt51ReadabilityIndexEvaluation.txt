  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTest_Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent immediately obvious.",
    "Consistent use of async Task signatures for asynchronous tests improves correctness and readability of async flows.",
    "AAA structure is followed throughout, often explicitly separated with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert, which makes each test easy to visually parse.",
    "Assertions are focused and expressive (including NSubstitute Received checks), clearly documenting expected behavior and side effects.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized scenarios (e.g., invalid user IDs) avoids duplication and keeps related cases grouped.",
    "Shared test setup via the constructor (substitutes, transaction, service) reduces noise in individual tests and makes common dependencies easy to understand.",
    "Some tests (e.g., AddAsync_ValidNote_ReturnsIdAndSetsProperties, UpdateAsync_ValidUpdate_ReturnsIdAndSetsProperties) are quite long with complex predicates and multiple assertions, which slightly reduces scan-ability and could benefit from small helper methods or local functions.",
    "There is repeated setup logic for similar entities and failure scenarios (e.g., Save failed cases) that could be extracted into helper methods to further improve maintainability and reduce duplication."
