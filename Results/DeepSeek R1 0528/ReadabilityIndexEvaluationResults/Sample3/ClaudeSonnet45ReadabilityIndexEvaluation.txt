		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'NoteServiceTests'",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with comments and blank line separation in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication in AddAsync_InvalidUserId tests",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout (noteModel, existingNoteEntity, userId, etc.)",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping tests clean and self-documenting",
		"Constructor setup is well-organized with substitutes clearly initialized",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation across all test methods",
		"Only minor issue: some tests could benefit from extracting magic numbers to named constants for better maintainability"
