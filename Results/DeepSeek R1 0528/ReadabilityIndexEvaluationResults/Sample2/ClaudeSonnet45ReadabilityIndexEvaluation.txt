	"readabilityIndex": 78,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern (EmployeeServiceTests)",
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"AAA pattern is clearly followed with appropriate comments (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and spacing",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for similar scenarios",
		"Constructor-based setup for dependencies is clean and follows common practices",
		"Variable and field naming is clear and follows C# conventions",
		"Some tests have excessive assertions (e.g., GetAsync_ExistingId_ReturnsMappedEmployeeModel has 15 individual assertions) which reduces maintainability",
		"Test 'AddAsync_InvalidFirstName_ThrowsArgumentException' has an unused 'dummy' parameter in InlineData, indicating possible code smell",
		"Minor inconsistency: test 'AddAsync_InvalidAddress_ThrowsArgumentExceptionWithCityParamName' has business logic details in the name that could be simplified"
