  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `EmployeeServiceTests` and method names follow the `ClassUnderTestTests` and `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` patterns, making intent clear.",
    "Consistent use of async `Task` test signatures and xUnit attributes (`[Fact]` for single scenarios, `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for variations) improves structure and readability.",
    "Tests mostly follow the AAA pattern with clear separation of Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks, improving logical flow.",
    "Naming of fields, variables, and test data (e.g., `validModel`, `invalidModel`, `employeeEntities`) is descriptive and self-explanatory.",
    "Use of NSubstitute is straightforward and consistent, with clear setup of repository behavior and verification of received calls.",
    "First test uses many field-by-field assertions which are explicit but somewhat verbose; a helper or comparison method could improve readability and reduce noise.",
    "`ListFilteredAsync` tests pass many positional literals (e.g., `\"\", \"\", \"\", 0, 0, 0, 0`, and repeated long argument lists) without named parameters, making it harder to see which filter is which.",
    "Inline data for some theories includes an unused `dummy` parameter and slightly confusing conventions around `expectedParamName`, which adds minor cognitive load.",
    "`// Act & Assert` comments deviate slightly from the strict `// Arrange // Act // Assert` convention, but the intent is still clear and consistent within the class."
