	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Most test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comment markers and blank line separation",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for similar scenarios",
		"Excessive inline comments within test bodies explain implementation details rather than letting code be self-documenting (e.g., logic calculations in assertions)",
		"Some assertions contain complex inline calculations (dotSpaceCount, spaceCount) that reduce immediate readability and could benefit from extracted helper methods or clearer variable names",
		"Variable names like 'wordParam', 'sentenceParam', 'minW', 'maxW' are somewhat abbreviated and could be more descriptive",
		"Good use of meaningful variable names in most tests (minWords, maxWords, numParagraphs)",
		"No unnecessary nested classes present, maintaining flat and clean structure",
		"Comments in assertions like '// Invalid' and calculation explanations add clutter that could be avoided with better-named variables or helper methods"
