		"Consistent use of AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and separation.",

		"Excessive explanatory comments beyond AAA markers, violating ideal of minimal comments.",
		"Code duplication in similar tests for string and HtmlSafe versions (e.g., zero paragraphs).",

		"Abbreviated variable names (e.g., minW, maxW) in some tests.",
