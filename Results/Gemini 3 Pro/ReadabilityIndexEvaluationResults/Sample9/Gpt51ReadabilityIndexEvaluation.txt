  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names consistently follow the ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns, making intent clear.",
    "AAA structure is used in all tests, with clear Arrange/Act/Assert (or Act & Assert) separation, which aids scanning and understanding.",
    "[Fact] and [Theory] are applied appropriately, with InlineData used to avoid duplication for parameterized scenarios.",
    "Most variable names are descriptive (minWords, maxSentences, numParagraphs), which improves readability of the scenarios.",
    "Several tests, especially the structure/space-count checks, contain dense logic and string manipulation in the assertions, which makes them harder to read and reason about at a glance.",
    "There are multiple explanatory comments that refer to internal SUT implementation details (Random logic, exact counting behavior), which couple tests to implementation and add noise for future readers.",
    "An unused local variable (sentenceEndingsCount) in one test introduces confusion and suggests leftover or dead code within the test body.",
    "The last test uses abbreviated variable names (minW, maxW, minS, maxS, paras) inconsistent with the more descriptive naming elsewhere, slightly reducing clarity.",
    "Inline comments beyond simple Arrange/Act/Assert separators are relatively verbose in places, which can hinder quick scanning of the core test flow."
