		"Test class follows ClassUnderTestTests naming convention (MatrixChainMultiplicationTests).",
		"Test method names follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, clearly describing the scenario.",
		"Tests consistently use the AAA pattern with clear Arrange-Act-Assert sections separated by comments.",
		"Theory tests with InlineData eliminate code duplication for multiple input cases.",
		"Variable names are meaningful (p, n, s, result) though 'p' could be more descriptive like 'dimensions'.",
		"Comments provide helpful context about matrix dimensions and expected optimal solutions.",
		"All tests use appropriate xUnit attributes ([Fact] and [Theory]).",
		"Assertions are clear and verify both expected results and additional conditions (e.g., s matrix not null).",
		"Good integration testing between MatrixChainOrder and GetOptimalParentheses methods.",
		"Minor improvement: InlineData parameter names in test signature could be more descriptive than 'p' and 'n'."
