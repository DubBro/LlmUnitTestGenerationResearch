  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `MatrixChainMultiplicationTests` clearly follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and reflects the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making each scenario self-descriptive.",
    "AAA structure is clearly used and explicitly separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert`, improving quick visual parsing of test logic.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple input variations of the same scenario avoids duplication and improves maintainability.",
    "Code formatting, indentation, and spacing are clean and consistent, aiding readability.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or complex test infrastructure; each test is focused and relatively short.",
    "Additional explanatory comments about matrix dimensions and optimal solutions help understand the intent and expected results, especially for a mathematically non-trivial algorithm.",
    "Variable names like `p`, `n`, and `s` are short and domain-specific but not self-explanatory, which slightly reduces readability for maintainers unfamiliar with the algorithm.",
    "Some comments go beyond AAA markers and mix explanation with code, which, while helpful, introduces a small amount of noise and potential for outdated comments over time.",
    "Overall structure and separation of concerns between tests for `MatrixChainOrder` and `GetOptimalParentheses` make the suite easy to navigate and extend."
