	"readabilityIndex": 78,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names clearly follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied and properly marked with comments in all tests",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for multiple input scenarios",
		"Inline comments within Arrange blocks provide helpful context explaining matrix dimensions and expected behavior",
		"Meaningful variable names (expectedCost, result, p, n, s) are used, though some are terse (p, n, s could be more descriptive)",
		"Tests are well-structured and logically organized, progressing from basic to complex scenarios",
		"Comments beyond AAA markers are present in Arrange blocks, which slightly deviates from the ideal (comments should only be AAA markers)",
		"The out parameter pattern (out int[,] s) makes assertions slightly less readable, but this is a constraint of the tested API",
		"Overall excellent readability with minor deviations: additional explanatory comments and terse parameter names"
