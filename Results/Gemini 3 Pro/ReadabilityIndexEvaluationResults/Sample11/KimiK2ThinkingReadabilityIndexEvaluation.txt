		"Multiple tests contain explanatory comments beyond the allowed Arrange/Act/Assert markers, violating the strict no-comments guideline",
		"Test class and method names follow established patterns (ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_Result) and are highly descriptive",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for testing multiple input variations and [Fact] for single scenarios",
		"All tests correctly implement the AAA pattern with clear section markers and proper separation by empty lines",
		"Variable names like 'p', 'n', 's' are standard for matrix chain multiplication domain, maintaining clarity",
		"No nested classes or unnecessary complexity in test structure",
		"Test methods focus on single responsibilities and have clear, verifiable assertions",
		"While extra comments provide mathematical context, they reduce maintainability per the specified guidelines"
