  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `EmployeeServiceTests` follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Individual test names mostly follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are descriptive (e.g., `AddAsync_InvalidPhone_ThrowsArgumentException`), making intent easy to understand.",
    "Consistent use of async signatures (`async Task`) and xUnit attributes (`[Fact]` for single cases, `[Theory]/[InlineData]` for variations) improves clarity and reduces duplication.",
    "AAA pattern is followed in almost all tests with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) comments and blank lines separating blocks, aiding quick visual parsing.",
    "Use of a common `CreateValidModel` helper reduces duplication, centralizes default setup, and makes individual tests focus on the specific variation being validated.",
    "Naming of variables and parameters is meaningful and domain-relevant (`entities`, `model`, `invalidPhone`, `minSalary`), improving readability of each scenario.",
    "Use of NSubstitute is clear and consistent (`Received`, `DidNotReceive`, `Arg.Is`, `Arg.Any`), making interactions with the repository easy to reason about.",
    "Some comments go beyond AAA separators to describe expectations or internals (e.g., regex behavior, source quirks), which adds noise and slightly reduces purity of the test surface.",
    "A few test names are slightly awkward or unclear (`AddAsync_WithRunOfPaperValidInputs_Succeeds`) and could be refined for better immediate understanding.",
    "The file is long with many similar validation tests; while individually clear, some grouping or partial class splitting could further enhance navigability and long-term maintainability."
