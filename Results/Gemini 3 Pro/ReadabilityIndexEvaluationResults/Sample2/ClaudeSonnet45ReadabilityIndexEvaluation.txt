	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern correctly",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern with clear, descriptive names",
		"All async tests properly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Consistent use of AAA pattern with clear comments separating Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks",
		"Excellent use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple input variations",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout (entity, model, result, invalidName, etc.)",
		"Helper method 'CreateValidModel()' effectively reduces code duplication and improves maintainability",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers; code is self-documenting",
		"Well-structured constructor setup with dependency injection using NSubstitute",
		"Minor inconsistency: some inline comments explaining edge cases (e.g., '// Should trim', '// Hyphen allowed') could be removed as test names are descriptive enough"
