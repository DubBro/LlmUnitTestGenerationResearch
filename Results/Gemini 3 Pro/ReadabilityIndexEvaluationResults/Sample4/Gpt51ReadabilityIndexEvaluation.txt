    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (CompanyServiceTests).",
    "Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and clearly communicate intent (e.g., GetAsync_WhenRepositoryThrowsException_ThrowsSameException).",
    "Consistent use of AAA structure with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and blank lines improves logical separation and readability.",
    "All async tests correctly use async Task signatures and avoid async void, aligning with best practices and improving maintainability.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameter variations (GetAsync_WhenCalledWithSpecificId_ReturnsMappedModel) reduces duplication and clarifies purpose.",
    "Mock setup with NSubstitute is straightforward and close to natural language, making behavior and expectations easy to understand.",
    "Assertions are explicit and focused (NotNull/Null, Equal, Received/DidNotReceive), making test outcomes clear.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested classes; the file is short and cohesive, focused on a single responsibility.",
    "Minor duplication in entity/model setup across tests could be slightly refactored (e.g., helper methods or builders) to further improve maintainability.",
    "Some tests mix behavioral verification (Received calls) with result verification, which is acceptable but could be streamlined to emphasize the primary behavior under test."
