		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comments and blank line separation in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication for testing multiple IDs",
		"Asynchronous tests correctly use 'async Task' signatures instead of 'async void'",
		"Variable and field names are clear, meaningful, and follow C# naming conventions",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
		"Constructor-based test setup with readonly fields promotes consistency and maintainability",
		"Tests are well-structured, easy to understand, and cover various scenarios systematically",
		"Minor: Some tests could use more descriptive variable names (e.g., 'id' could be 'companyId'), but overall readability remains very high"
