		"Test class name follows the correct pattern (CaesarEncoderTests).",
		"Test method names are descriptive and follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"All tests use the AAA pattern with clear comments to separate Arrange, Act, Assert blocks.",
		"[Theory] is appropriately used for parameterized tests, avoiding code duplication.",
		"Good use of InlineData attributes with clear test case descriptions.",
		"Variables and parameters have meaningful names (e.g., input, key, expected).",
		"Tests are well-structured and each test focuses on a single scenario.",
		"Code is cleanly formatted with proper spacing and indentation.",
		"The round-trip test has a clear purpose and includes two assertions (transformation occurred, reversibility).",
		"Minor point: One test (Encode_WhenTextContainsNonLetters_LeavesNonLettersUnchanged) contains a manual expected value calculation inside the test, which slightly reduces clarity but is acceptable with the comment."
