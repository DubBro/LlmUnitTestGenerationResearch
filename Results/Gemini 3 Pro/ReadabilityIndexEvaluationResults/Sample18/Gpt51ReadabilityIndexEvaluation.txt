  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns closely.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized scenarios is appropriate and avoids duplication.",
    "AAA structure is consistently followed, with logical separation of Arrange, Act, and Assert; simple cases are clearly marked as Arrange & Act, which remains readable.",
    "Formatting, spacing, and C# naming conventions are clean and consistent, making the tests easy to scan and navigate.",
    "Test data in most theories is explicit (including expected values in InlineData), which makes behavior easy to understand at a glance.",
    "Some tests compute expected values inside the test body (e.g., conditional expected string for non-letter handling), which slightly obscures intent compared to passing explicit expected values via InlineData.",
    "Additional explanatory comments beyond // Arrange/Act/Assert (e.g., ROT13 notes, wrap logic) are mostly helpful but technically deviate from the described ideal of having only AAA comments, slightly lowering the score."
