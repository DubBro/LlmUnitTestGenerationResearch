		"Class and method names follow recommended patterns (ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult).",
		"Consistent use of AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert separators.",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] and [InlineData] to test variations without code duplication.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names and standard C# conventions.",
		"Good separation of concerns and logical test organization.",
		"Minor issue: extra comments in InlineData attributes and one test body beyond AAA markers.",
		"One test uses manual expected value calculation in Arrange, slightly reducing clarity.",
		"Some test names are descriptive but occasionally lengthy or slightly vague."
