	"readabilityIndex": 88,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern correctly",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"Proper use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests",
		"Clear AAA pattern separation with appropriate comments in most tests",
		"Variable and parameter names are meaningful and descriptive",
		"Tests are well-organized and grouped logically by scenario type",
		"Good use of Theory tests to avoid code duplication for similar scenarios",
		"Minor issue: Some Theory tests combine Arrange and Act phases ('// Arrange & Act'), though this is acceptable for simple scenarios",
		"One test contains an inline comment beyond AAA markers ('// Expected: \"B 1 c .\"'), slightly deviating from the ideal",
		"Overall excellent readability with minimal violations of best practices"
	]
