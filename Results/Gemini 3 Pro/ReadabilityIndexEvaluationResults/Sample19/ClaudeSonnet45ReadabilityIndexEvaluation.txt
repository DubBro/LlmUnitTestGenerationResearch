		"Test class name follows the correct pattern: StringExtensionsTests",
		"Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern with clear, descriptive scenarios",
		"Excellent use of Theory with InlineData to avoid code duplication across similar test cases",
		"AAA pattern is clearly marked with comments and blocks are well-separated by empty lines",
		"Regional organization (#region) provides clear logical grouping of tests by method under test",
		"Variable naming is clear and consistent (input, expected, result)",
		"Inline comments in InlineData attributes provide helpful context for edge cases without cluttering test bodies",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout all test methods",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or complex structures that would hinder readability",
		"Minor point: Arrange comments stating '(Input provided via parameter)' are somewhat redundant but do not significantly impact readability"
