  "readabilityIndex": 94,
  "reasons": [
    "Class and method names follow clear, expressive patterns like ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult, making intent immediately obvious",
    "Consistent use of [Theory]/[InlineData] versus [Fact] avoids duplication and cleanly expresses multiple input variations for the same scenario",
    "AAA structure is consistently applied and visually separated, making each test’s flow (setup, act, assert) easy to follow",
    "Test data in InlineData is well chosen and often self-explanatory, covering edge cases that are easy to understand at a glance",
    "No nested test classes or unnecessary indirection; the structure is flat and straightforward to navigate",
    "Naming of parameters (input, expected, c, s) is concise yet descriptive in context, aiding quick comprehension",
    "Regions are used to group tests by extension method, which helps navigation, though slightly increases visual noise",
    "Comments explaining special cases in InlineData (e.g., int.MaxValue, ASCII ranges) improve understanding but go slightly beyond minimal necessary documentation",
    "Repeated placeholder comments like \"// (Input provided via parameters)\" are redundant and add minor clutter",
    "Code formatting (spacing, line breaks, attribute placement) is consistent and adheres to standard C# conventions, enhancing scanability"
