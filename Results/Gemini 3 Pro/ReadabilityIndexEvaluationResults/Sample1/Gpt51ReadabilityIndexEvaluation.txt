    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (DepartmentServiceTests).",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are very descriptive.",
    "AAA pattern is clearly used and visually separated by comments and blank lines, making test flow easy to follow.",
    "Asynchronous tests correctly use async Task signatures, improving clarity and avoiding async void pitfalls.",
    "Variable and field names (_departmentRepositorySubstitute, entity, result, expectedException) are meaningful and self-explanatory.",
    "Use of NSubstitute is straightforward and readable with clear setup and verification (Returns, Throws, Received).",
    "Assertions are explicit and focused, often checking multiple relevant properties, which makes the intent of each test clear.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or unrelated comments; the test file is structurally simple and easy to navigate.",
    "Code adheres to standard C# naming and formatting conventions, which improves readability and consistency.",
    "Some minor duplication between similar tests (e.g., GetAsync scenarios) could be reduced with helper methods or theories, but this does not significantly harm readability."
