		"Test class follows the recommended naming pattern 'DepartmentServiceTests'",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with explicit comments and proper blank line separation",
		"Asynchronous tests correctly use 'async Task' signatures instead of 'async void'",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (e.g., 'expectedException', 'actualException', 'entity')",
		"Test setup is properly centralized in the constructor using dependency injection",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping the code clean",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout all tests",
		"Could potentially use [Theory] with [InlineData] for similar scenarios like exception handling tests to reduce duplication",
		"Overall excellent readability with very minor room for optimization through parameterized tests"
