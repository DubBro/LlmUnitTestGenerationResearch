{
	"readabilityIndex": 78,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern, making it immediately clear what is being tested",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently, providing clear documentation of intent",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with clear comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and appropriate spacing",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication in the GetMatrix tests",
		"Inline comments within assertion blocks (e.g., 'Verify L is lower triangular', 'Logic check') add unnecessary noise and violate the guideline of only using AAA comments",
		"Helper method 'MultiplyMatrices' is well-named and appropriately placed as a private method to support test verification",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (e.g., 'originalMatrix', 'luProduct', 'originalRowIndex')",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout the test file enhances readability",
		"Some tests contain extensive assertion logic with nested loops that could potentially be extracted into helper methods for improved maintainability",
		"Overall structure is logical and easy to follow, with tests progressing from valid cases to edge cases and error conditions"
