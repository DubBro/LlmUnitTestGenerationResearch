		"Class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern perfectly.",
		"Test method names are descriptive and mostly adhere to MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Consistent AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and clear separation by empty lines.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable and parameter names reflecting purpose.",
		"Adheres to C# naming conventions and standard formatting.",
		"Private helper method (MultiplyMatrices) improves maintainability by reducing code duplication.",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or complexity.",
		"Minor flaw: explanatory comments present beyond AAA markers.",
		"Some assertions use loops for matrix verification, which are readable but add length."
