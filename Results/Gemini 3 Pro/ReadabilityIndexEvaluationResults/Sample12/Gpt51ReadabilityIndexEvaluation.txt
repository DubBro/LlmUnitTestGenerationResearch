  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (LUPDecompositionTests), immediately conveying the subject under test.",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent very clear (e.g., Decompose_Valid3x3Matrix_CalculatesLUPCorrectly).",
    "AAA structure is consistently applied and visually separated with comments // Arrange, // Act, // Assert, which improves scanability.",
    "Variable names (matrix, originalMatrix, luProduct, P, n) are meaningful and domain-appropriate, aiding quick comprehension of math-heavy logic.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory]/[InlineData] for parameterized cases is correct and avoids duplication where appropriate.",
    "Helper method MultiplyMatrices is extracted, reducing noise in individual tests and centralizing a non-trivial operation, which improves maintainability.",
    "Comments are generally focused on clarifying mathematical intent and behavior, which is helpful, although they exceed the ideal of only AAA comments.",
    "Some tests (especially Decompose_Valid3x3Matrix_CalculatesLUPCorrectly) bundle multiple verification concerns into a single method, making them longer and slightly harder to parse at a glance.",
    "Minor repetition exists in verifying P * A = L * U across tests; extracting a shared helper for this verification could further increase clarity and reduce duplication.",
    "Formatting, indentation, and use of C#/.NET naming conventions are consistent, contributing to overall readability."
