  "readabilityIndex": 86,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns, making each test’s purpose obvious.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently followed and clearly separated with Arrange/Act/Assert comments, which improves structure and scanability.",
    "Naming of variables (matrix, coefficients, solution, pivot, exception) is meaningful and domain-appropriate, aiding quick understanding.",
    "Code style (formatting, spacing, brace placement, use of var) is consistent and adheres to common C# conventions, enhancing readability.",
    "No unnecessary nesting or complex test fixtures; tests are self-contained and straightforward to follow.",
    "The large Decompose_WhenMatrixIsSquare_ReturnsCorrectLowerAndUpperMatrices test contains multiple nested loops and many assertions, making it somewhat dense and harder to digest; it could be split into smaller tests or helper methods.",
    "Comments are mostly helpful but go beyond the recommended // Arrange/Act/Assert separators; inline equation comments, while explanatory, slightly deviate from the minimal-comment guideline and could be encoded in helper methods or data where possible.",
    "Repeated setup (new Lu() and similar matrix/coefficients initialization) could be factored into helper methods or test data builders to reduce duplication and further improve maintainability."
