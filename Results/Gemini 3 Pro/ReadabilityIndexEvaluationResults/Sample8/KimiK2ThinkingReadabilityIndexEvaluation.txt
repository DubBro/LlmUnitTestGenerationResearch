 {"readabilityIndex":67,"reasons":["Test class and method names follow the ClassUnderTestTests and MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns consistently","Contains explanatory comments beyond AAA separators (e.g., // Equation: 4x = 8 => x = 2), violating the ideal of self-documenting tests","The three Eliminate_WhenSystemIs1x1/2x2/3x3 tests are a clear case of code duplication and should be a [Theory]","The Decompose_WhenMatrixIsSquare_ReturnsCorrectLowerAndUpperMatrices test's Assert block uses complex nested loops with inline comments, making verification logic difficult to follow","The variable pivot is hardcoded and poorly named; it should reflect 'dimension' or 'size' and be derived from the input","The tolerance value 8 in Assert.Equal is a magic number without a descriptive constant","The // Act & Assert combined comment in exception tests is acceptable but slightly inconsistent with pure AAA separation","No unnecessary nested classes; test structure is simple and flat","Local variable names (matrix, coefficients, solution) are clear and descriptive","The code follows standard C# naming and formatting conventions"]}
