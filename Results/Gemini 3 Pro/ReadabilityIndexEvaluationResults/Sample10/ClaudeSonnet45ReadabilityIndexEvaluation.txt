	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern (AuctionServiceTests)",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern throughout",
		"Excellent use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple input variations",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with clear comments (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and proper separation",
		"No extraneous comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean and focused",
		"Region blocks (#region) effectively organize tests by method under test, improving navigation and maintainability",
		"Variable and field names are clear, meaningful, and follow C# naming conventions consistently",
		"Constructor properly sets up test dependencies using NSubstitute in a clear and maintainable way",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test methods makes the test suite highly predictable and easy to read",
		"Minor point: 'Act & Assert' is combined in exception tests, which is acceptable but slightly deviates from strict AAA separation"
