  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names consistently follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns, making intent immediately clear.",
    "Fields, local variables, and substitutes are well named and domain-specific (e.g., auction, bid, customerName), aiding comprehension.",
    "Tests are well structured around the AAA pattern with clear separation, even when Act & Assert are combined for exception scenarios.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for invalid ID cases reduces duplication and clearly expresses parameterized scenarios.",
    "Logical grouping of tests by method (Bet, CloseAuction, GetAuction, GetAuctions, OpenAuction) via regions makes navigation and maintenance straightforward.",
    "Setup via constructor with shared substitutes (IUnitOfWork, IAuctionRepository, IMapper) avoids repeated boilerplate and keeps individual tests focused.",
    "Some repetition of magic values (e.g., id = 1, error message strings) and repeated Auction object constructions could be refactored into helpers or constants to further improve maintainability.",
    "A few comments beyond simple AAA markers (e.g., explanatory inline comments and \"// Arrange & Act & Assert\") slightly diverge from the ideal minimalist style but do not significantly harm readability."
