	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern correctly",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comments and blank line separation in all tests",
		"Effective use of [Theory] and [InlineData] to reduce code duplication for multiple input scenarios",
		"Field and variable names are clear, meaningful, and follow C# naming conventions",
		"Test setup in constructor is clean and well-organized with mocks properly initialized",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code focused and clean",
		"Consistent assertion style and verification patterns across all tests",
		"Some inline comments explain business logic (e.g., 'Verifies logic: lot.Auction = new AuctionDTO()') which slightly deviates from the ideal of comment-free tests beyond AAA markers",
		"Overall excellent readability and maintainability with clear intent and structure throughout"
