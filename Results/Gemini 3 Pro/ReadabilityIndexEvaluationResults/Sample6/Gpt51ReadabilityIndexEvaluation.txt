  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (LotServiceTests) and clearly expresses the subject under test.",
    "Most test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are descriptive (e.g., AddLot_ValidLot_AddsLotAndCommits).",
    "AAA structure is consistently used and usually clearly separated (with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert or // Act & Assert), making test flow easy to follow.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for variant inputs is appropriate and reduces duplication.",
    "Field and variable names (_unitOfWork, _lotRepository, lotDto, entities, dtos, id) are clear, consistent, and conform to C# conventions.",
    "Centralized Arrange setup in the constructor (mocks and _sut) is straightforward and keeps individual tests focused on their specific scenario.",
    "Inline comments beyond AAA (e.g., explaining business logic or library behavior) add some noise and slightly reduce visual clarity.",
    "Occasional mixing of Act & Assert with additional assertions afterwards (e.g., in DeleteLot_InvalidId_ThrowsInvalidIdException) breaks strict AAA consistency, though still understandable.",
    "Some repeated Arrange patterns (creating lists, mapping setups) could be extracted into small helpers or factory methods to further improve maintainability.",
    "A few comments describe implementation details rather than test intent, which can become outdated and marginally harm long-term readability."
