	"reasons": [
		"Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and consistently follow recommended patterns",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with comments and empty line separation in all tests",
		"Correct usage of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple inputs",
		"All async tests properly return Task instead of void",
		"Variable and parameter names are meaningful and reflect their purpose",
		"Structural comments (// --- Section ---) improve navigation but violate 'no extra comments' guideline",
		"Some Arrange sections are lengthy with complex object initialization, reducing quick scanability",
		"One test uses a complex lambda assertion with Arg.Is that is harder to read at a glance",
		"Occasional inline comments explaining business logic break the strict AAA-only comment rule",
		"Overall excellent organization with minimal duplication and clear test intent"
