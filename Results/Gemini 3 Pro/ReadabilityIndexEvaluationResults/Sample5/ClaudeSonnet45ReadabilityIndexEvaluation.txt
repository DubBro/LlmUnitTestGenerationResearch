		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comments and logical separation",
		"Async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for parameter validation tests",
		"Meaningful variable names throughout the tests that clearly reflect their purpose",
		"One comment violation: 'Logic explicitly sets this to null!' is not an AAA separator comment",
		"Tests are well-structured with constructor-based setup for dependency injection using NSubstitute",
		"Section comments like '--- GetRootFoldersAsync Tests ---' are not AAA separators but improve organization",
		"Overall excellent readability with only minor comment-related deviations from the ideal"
