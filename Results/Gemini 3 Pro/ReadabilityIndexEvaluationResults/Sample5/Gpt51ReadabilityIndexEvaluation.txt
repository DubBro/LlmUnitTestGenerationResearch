  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (`FolderServiceTests`), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are descriptive, making intent easy to understand.",
    "AAA structure is used in all tests with explicit `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, keeping the flow clear.",
    "Asynchronous scenarios correctly use `async Task` signatures and await patterns, avoiding `async void` pitfalls.",
    "Use of `[Fact]` for single scenarios and `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for input variations reduces duplication and improves maintainability.",
    "Test sections are logically grouped by method under test using header comments (e.g., `// --- GetFolderAsync Tests ---`), aiding navigation.",
    "Naming of variables and test data (`folderEntities`, `rootFolder`, `leafFolder`, `folderDto`) is clear and domain-specific, improving readability.",
    "Assertions are generally straightforward and focused, though some tests contain many assertions which slightly increase cognitive load.",
    "A number of inline explanatory comments (e.g., `// Logic explicitly sets this to null!`, `// Should handle slashes via Trim/Split`) go beyond pure AAA markers and add minor noise, slightly detracting from the clean test style.",
    "Some repeated setup patterns (creating similar `FolderEntity` instances) could be extracted into helpers/builders to reduce duplication and further improve readability and maintainability."
