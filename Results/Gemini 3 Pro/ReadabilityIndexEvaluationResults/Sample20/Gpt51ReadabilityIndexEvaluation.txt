  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_Result patterns, making the intent of each test immediately obvious.",
    "Tests are consistently structured using the AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert separators, which improves scanability.",
    "Formatting, spacing, and brace style are consistent, aiding quick visual parsing of individual tests.",
    "Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory]/[InlineData] for parameterized cases avoids duplication and clarifies scenario variation.",
    "Variable names (shuffler, original, array, seed, expected) are meaningful and make the test logic easy to follow.",
    "Test bodies are short and focused, each validating a single clear behavior, which improves maintainability.",
    "Minor readability downsides include additional inline comments beyond AAA, repeated shuffler instantiations with slightly varying generic types, and the use of the null-forgiving operator, which adds small cognitive overhead."
