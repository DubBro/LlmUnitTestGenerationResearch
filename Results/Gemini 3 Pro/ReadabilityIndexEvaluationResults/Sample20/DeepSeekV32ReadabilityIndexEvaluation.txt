		"Test class name follows standard pattern: FisherYatesShufflerTests",
		"Test methods follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult naming convention",
		"All tests use AAA pattern with clear comments separating Arrange, Act, Assert blocks",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication for seed parameter testing",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (shuffler, array, original, seed)",
		"Proper use of both synchronous tests without async void issues",
		"Tests are well-structured with logical separation between different scenarios",
		"Assertions are clear and easy to understand",
		"Tests cover edge cases (null, empty, single element) along with main scenarios",
		"Minor deduction: Some test names could be slightly more descriptive (e.g., 'Shuffle_WhenArrayHasOneElement_DoesNotChangeArray' could specify expected behavior more precisely)"
