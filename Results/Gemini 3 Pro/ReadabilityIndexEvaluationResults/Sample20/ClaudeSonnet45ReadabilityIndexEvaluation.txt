	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with appropriate comments and blank line separation in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication when testing multiple seed values",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (e.g., 'shuffler', 'original', 'array', 'seed')",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA pattern markers, keeping code clean",
		"Tests follow standard C# and .NET naming conventions throughout",
		"Good test coverage scenarios including edge cases (null, empty, single element, deterministic, non-deterministic)",
		"Minor deviation: one test combines Act & Assert on the same line for exception testing, though this is a common accepted pattern",
		"Overall excellent readability, well-structured, and easy to maintain with consistent formatting"
