		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names precisely follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Excellent use of [Theory] and [InlineData] for parameterized tests, avoiding duplication.",
		"Strict adherence to AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert separators and empty lines.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names (e.g., result, expected, count).",
		"Adheres to C# naming conventions and standard formatting.",
		"Minor deduction for extra explanatory comments beyond AAA markers, violating ideal of no other comments.",
		"Inconsistent assertion styles: some use full expected arrays, others individual cell checks.",
		"Local functions for Act in [Theory] tests slightly less direct than inline lambdas.",
		"Commented-out using directive with explanation adds minor clutter."
