		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"Proper use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple inputs",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with comment separators and empty lines between blocks",
		"Meaningful variable names (count, result, expected) that reflect their purpose",
		"Good use of inline comments to explain complex expected patterns, particularly in count=3 and count=5 tests",
		"Excessive inline comments explaining test logic reduce code clarity (e.g., 'The input count is provided by InlineData', detailed algorithm traces)",
		"The count=7 test uses structural assertions rather than complete expected array verification, which is inconsistent with other tests",
		"Standard C# and .NET naming conventions are properly followed throughout",
		"No unnecessary nested classes, proper attribute usage, and clean code structure overall"
