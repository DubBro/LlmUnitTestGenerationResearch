  "readabilityIndex": 89,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (RhombusGeneratorTests), making its purpose immediately clear.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, clearly describing intent and behavior.",
    "All tests follow the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) structure with explicit comments and spacing, improving logical flow and readability.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for invalid and even counts avoids duplication and keeps similar scenarios grouped and maintainable.",
    "Assertions are straightforward and localized, using descriptive variable names (e.g., exception, result, expected) which aids understanding.",
    "No nested test classes or unnecessary structural complexity; the file layout is flat and easy to navigate.",
    "Multi-line explanatory comments within tests (e.g., logical traces for patterns) are helpful but somewhat verbose, adding noise and potential maintenance overhead if logic changes.",
    "Comments beyond AAA markers (including the NSubstitute and algorithm description comments) slightly detract from the otherwise clean test layout.",
    "Some repeated dimension assertions across tests could be refactored into a helper or custom assertion to reduce minor duplication, though this does not heavily impact readability."
