  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and consistently follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns, making intent immediately obvious.",
    "All async tests correctly use async Task signatures, and the use of [Fact] vs [Theory]/[InlineData] is appropriate, enhancing clarity and reusability for parameterized scenarios.",
    "Tests mostly follow a clean AAA structure with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert sections, which makes the flow of each test easy to follow.",
    "Shared setup for substitutes and the system under test is centralized in the constructor, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.",
    "Assertions are generally straightforward and domain-focused, and verifications on substitutes (Received/DidNotReceive) are clearly tied to the scenario under test.",
    "Use of meaningful local variable names (userId, noteId, existingEntity, model, originalDate, etc.) improves readability and reduces the cognitive load when scanning tests.",
    "A few tests (e.g., AddAsync_WhenValid and UpdateAsync_WhenValid) contain relatively dense predicates inside Arg.Is and multiple verification concerns in a single test, which slightly reduces readability and could be split or simplified.",
    "The presence of occasional inline explanatory comments beyond AAA (e.g., about trimming or ID resetting) deviates from the minimal-comment ideal but remains helpful and not noisy, only slightly impacting stylistic consistency."
