	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, making test intent immediately clear",
		"Excellent use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication across similar test scenarios",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators and empty lines between sections",
		"Variable and parameter names are meaningful and self-explanatory (e.g., 'plainText', 'expectedBase64', 'invalidBase64Data')",
		"Comments in Arrange sections appropriately indicate when no setup is required for static utility methods",
		"Consistent formatting and code style throughout all test methods",
		"Good coverage of edge cases (null, empty, whitespace) and valid scenarios without redundancy",
		"The 'Act & Assert' comment in the exception test appropriately reflects the combined nature of that assertion",
		"Minor point: one inline comment explains Base64 length requirement, which could be considered unnecessary but doesn't significantly detract from readability"
