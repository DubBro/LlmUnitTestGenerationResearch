		"Test class name `Base64HelpersTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and reflects the subject under test.",
		"Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern, making intent immediately clear.",
		"Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for input variations avoids duplication and groups related scenarios logically.",
		"AAA pattern is followed in every test, with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` separators and blank lines enhancing visual structure.",
		"Parameter names and local variable names (`plainText`, `expectedBase64`, `base64Data`, etc.) are self-explanatory and domain-appropriate.",
		"Tests are short, focused, and each covers a single scenario, which improves scanability and future maintainability.",
		"Formatting is consistent (spacing, braces, line breaks), making the code easy to visually parse.",
		"Unnecessary complexity is avoided; tests target simple behaviors of a static helper class with minimal setup.",
		"Null-forgiving operator (`!`) in some tests is slightly distracting and may raise questions, but does not significantly harm readability.",
		"Occasional inline comments in attributes and ‘No specific state setup required’ comments are mildly redundant but not confusing."
