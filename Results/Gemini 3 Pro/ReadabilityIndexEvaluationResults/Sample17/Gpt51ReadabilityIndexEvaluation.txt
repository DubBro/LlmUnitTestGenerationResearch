  "readabilityIndex": 95,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `VectorExtensionsTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern and matches the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern, making each test’s intent immediately clear.",
    "All tests follow a clean AAA (Arrange–Act–Assert) structure with explicit comments and blank lines separating the blocks.",
    "Use of `[Fact]` for single scenarios and `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple input variations is appropriate and avoids duplication.",
    "Variable names inside tests (`vector`, `lhs`, `rhs`, `result`, `expected`, `source`) are generally meaningful and make the data roles easy to understand.",
    "Assertions are straightforward, granular, and grouped logically, which helps trace failures to specific aspects of the behavior.",
    "Formatting is consistent (indentation, spacing, brace style), with no superfluous comments or noise, contributing to quick scan-ability.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or complex setup code; tests remain short, focused, and easy to maintain.",
    "Exception tests clearly separate action delegates (`Action act = ...`) and assertion of exception type and message, improving clarity.",
    "Minor nitpick: use of abbreviated names like `lhs` and `rhs` is slightly less descriptive than fully spelled alternatives, but does not significantly hinder readability."
