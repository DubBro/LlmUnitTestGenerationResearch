		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication in Magnitude_WhenCalled_ReturnsEuclideanMagnitude test",
		"Variable and field names are clear, meaningful, and reflect their purpose",
		"Code adheres to standard C# and .NET naming conventions throughout",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping the code clean",
