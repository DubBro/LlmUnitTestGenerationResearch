		"Test class name follows the standard pattern: VectorExtensionsTests",
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with clear Arrange/Act/Assert separation",
		"Test structure is consistent and well-organized with proper use of Fact/Theory",
		"[Theory] is appropriately used for Magnitude method to avoid code duplication",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful",
		"Assertions are straightforward and easy to understand",
