	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the correct pattern (AsciiHelpersTests for AsciiHelpers)",
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with clear comment separators in all tests",
		"Excellent use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication across similar scenarios",
		"Variable and parameter names are clear and meaningful (input, expected, replacement, result)",
		"Code follows standard C# and .NET naming conventions throughout",
		"Good use of comments '// Handled by InlineData' to explain when Arrange block has no additional setup",
		"Tests demonstrate both static method calls (AsciiHelpers.Method) and extension method calls (input.Method) appropriately",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test methods makes the code easy to scan and understand",
		"Minor issue: one comment explaining non-ASCII character usage in RemoveNonAsciiChars_WhenInputIsOnlyNonAsciiAndNotWhitespace_ReturnsEmptyString goes beyond AAA separators, though it adds value"
