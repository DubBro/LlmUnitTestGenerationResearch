		"Excellent adherence to AAA pattern with clear // Arrange, // Act, // Assert separators in all tests",
		"Test method names closely follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] and [InlineData] to handle multiple inputs without code duplication",
		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests convention",
		"Good overall structure and formatting, easy to follow",
		"Minor inconsistency in calling static methods vs. extension methods across similar tests",
		"Unnecessary extra comments like '// Handled by InlineData' and explanatory notes beyond AAA separators",
		"Slightly awkward phrasing in one test name: 'ReplaceAllCharacters'"
