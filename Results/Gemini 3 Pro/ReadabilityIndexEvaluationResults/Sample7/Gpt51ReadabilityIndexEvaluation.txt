  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `WalkServiceTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention, making the subject under test immediately obvious.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are descriptive, aiding quick understanding of each scenario.",
    "All async tests correctly return `Task` and use `await` with `Assert.ThrowsAsync`, matching best practices for asynchronous test readability.",
    "AAA pattern is clearly followed and visually separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert`, making the structure of each test easy to scan.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for invalid IMEI variations reduces duplication and keeps related scenarios grouped and readable.",
    "Mocks are created and injected in the constructor, centralizing setup and keeping individual tests focused on the behavior they validate.",
    "Assertions are straightforward and explicit (e.g., `Assert.Collection` with detailed checks), making the expected outcomes easy to understand.",
    "Inline comments on `[InlineData]` values annotate intent of each case, improving clarity of edge cases being tested.",
    "Some comments like `// No setup needed` are redundant and introduce minor noise, slightly impacting overall cleanliness.",
    "Repeated literal IMEI strings could be extracted to constants for easier maintenance and to reduce magic values across tests."
