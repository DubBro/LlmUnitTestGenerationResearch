  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `OntologyHelperTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and matches the domain.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and make the intent immediately clear.",
    "All tests follow a strict AAA structure with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments and blank line separation, which improves scanability.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for the non-URI/non-literal node types avoids duplication and clarifies a shared scenario.",
    "Variable names like `expectedResult`, `rawString`, `node`, and `result` are meaningful and self-explanatory.",
    "Setup with NSubstitute is simple, uniform, and placed in the Arrange section, making the mocked behavior easy to understand.",
    "No unnecessary nesting or helper classes inside the test class; structure is flat and straightforward.",
    "Comments that explain internal logic (e.g., how `IndexOf` and `Substring` behave) go beyond AAA markers and slightly clutter the tests.",
    "Several tests duplicate similar mock setup patterns for `INode`, which could be extracted into a small helper method to reduce repetition and ease future changes.",
    "Some test method names are quite long, which, while descriptive, can reduce quick visual scanning when the test suite grows larger."
