		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with clear comments and blank line separation in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple NodeType values",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (expectedResult, rawString, node, result)",
		"Good use of inline comments to explain business logic in edge cases without cluttering the code",
		"Consistent formatting and indentation throughout all test methods",
		"Proper use of NSubstitute mocking framework with clear setup",
		"All async scenarios would use 'async Task' pattern (none present, but structure supports it)",
		"Very minor: some inline logic comments could be removed as test names are already descriptive, but they add clarity for complex edge cases"
