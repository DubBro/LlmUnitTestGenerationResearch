	"readabilityIndex": 73,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class follows the correct naming pattern 'LotServiceTests' and all test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and appropriate empty lines between sections",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication when testing multiple input variations of the same scenario",
		"The CreateSut() helper method effectively reduces setup duplication, though the complex tuple return type with five elements reduces clarity and could be improved with a dedicated fixture class",
		"The mapper setup in CreateSut() contains extensive manual mapping logic (60+ lines) that obscures the test setup and makes the helper method difficult to maintain",
		"Variable naming is generally clear ('service', 'dto', 'lots', 'auctions'), though some could be more descriptive (e.g., 'e' for entity, 'ci' for callback info in mapper setup)",
		"Good use of discard pattern (_) in tuple deconstruction when certain dependencies are not needed in specific tests",
		"Tests are well-structured with clear assertions that verify both direct results and mock interactions using NSubstitute's Received() syntax",
		"The code adheres to C# naming conventions and formatting standards throughout, contributing to overall readability"
