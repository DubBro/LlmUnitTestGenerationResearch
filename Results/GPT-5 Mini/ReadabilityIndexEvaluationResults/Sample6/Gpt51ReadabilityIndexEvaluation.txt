  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_Result pattern, making intent easy to understand.",
    "Tests consistently follow the AAA pattern with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and visual separation, which improves scanability.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory]/[InlineData] for parameterized cases avoids duplication and keeps similar scenarios grouped and readable.",
    "Dependencies are created via a single CreateSut helper, reducing boilerplate in individual tests and keeping each test body focused on behavior under test.",
    "The long tuple returned from CreateSut and frequent use of discards (var (service, _, _, _, _)) reduce clarity because readers must remember the tuple element order.",
    "CreateSut contains large, custom mapping lambdas with repetitive object initializers that introduce noise and make the overall fixture setup harder to grasp and maintain.",
    "Mock/Stub naming (db, lots, auctions, mapper, dto, domain) is consistent and meaningful, but the combination of multiple mocks passed via tuple slightly increases cognitive load.",
    "Test bodies are short, well-formatted, and mostly free of extraneous comments or logic, but there is some repetition in collection setup (domainList/mappedList) that could be abstracted for even better maintainability."
