		"High setup code duplication: repository and service instantiation repeated in every test method, reducing maintainability",
		"Extremely long 101-character string literal in InlineData is unreadable and lacks clear intent",
		"Non-standard namespace 'Gpt5MiniUnitTests' does not follow typical C# naming conventions",
		"Complex FolderEntity object graphs created inline without helper methods, increasing test verbosity",
		"Verbose lambda assertions with multiple AND conditions reduce clarity of verification logic",
		"Test method names are descriptive and consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Proper use of async Task signatures and AAA pattern comments throughout all tests"
