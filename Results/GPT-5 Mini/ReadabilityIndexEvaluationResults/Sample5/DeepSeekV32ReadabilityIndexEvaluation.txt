		"Test class follows naming convention (FolderServiceTests), method names use clear MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"All tests use async Task signature, adhering to async testing best practices",
		"Tests follow AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert comments and logical separation",
		"Proper use of Theory with InlineData for parameterized tests reduces code duplication",
		"Good variable naming and consistent test structure throughout",
		"Clear use of comments only for AAA blocks, avoiding unnecessary comments",
		"Proper assertion patterns with meaningful verification messages",
		"Good separation of test cases for different scenarios (null path, non-existent folders, nested paths)",
		"Uses appropriate mocking library (NSubstitute) with clear setup",
		"Only minor issue: some test names could be slightly more descriptive about the specific invalid scenario"
