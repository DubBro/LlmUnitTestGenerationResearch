  "readabilityIndex": 90,
  "reasons": [
    "Clear and consistent test class and method naming following the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_Result patterns, making intent easy to understand.",
    "Tests generally follow the AAA structure with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments (or combined Act/Assert where appropriate), giving a clear flow.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for invalid ID scenarios reduces duplication and improves maintainability.",
    "Common setup is centralized in the CreateSut helper, eliminating repeated boilerplate and making dependencies explicit and easy to scan.",
    "Variable names (sut, repo, db, mapper, auction, dto, result, ex) are conventional and descriptive enough for test purposes.",
    "Formatting and spacing are consistent: each test is compact, blocks are separated by blank lines, and object initializers are neatly formatted.",
    "Assertions are focused and usually check a single behavior per test, which keeps each test small and readable.",
    "Minor inconsistency with \"// Act / Assert\" combined comments and some repetitive creation of similar Auction/AuctionDTO instances slightly detracts from perfect clarity but does not significantly harm readability."
