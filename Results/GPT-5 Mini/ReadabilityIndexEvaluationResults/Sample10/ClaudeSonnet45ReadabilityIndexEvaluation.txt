	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the correct pattern (AuctionServiceTests)",
		"Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comments and separation",
		"Excellent use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for similar scenarios",
		"Helper method CreateSut() reduces duplication and improves maintainability",
		"Clear and descriptive variable names (sut, repo, mapper, auction, dto)",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all tests makes them easy to scan",
		"Minor issue: CreateSut() uses tuple deconstruction which is acceptable but adds slight cognitive load",
		"All async scenarios are avoided (no async void), and code follows C# naming conventions",
		"Tests are well-organized and logically grouped by method under test"
