  "readabilityIndex": 88,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (DepartmentServiceTests), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Test method names consistently use the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent of each test obvious.",
    "Async tests correctly use async Task signatures and are clearly written with straightforward await usage.",
    "AAA structure is consistently followed with Arrange/Act/Assert comments; exception tests use an explicit 'Act & Assert' block which remains understandable.",
    "Variable and field names (repository, entity, service, result, entities) are descriptive and aligned with .NET naming conventions.",
    "Tests are compact, with minimal noise and no extraneous comments, making them easy to scan and understand.",
    "Use of NSubstitute is clear and localized within each test, avoiding hidden magic and keeping setup close to assertions.",
    "Some duplication of Arrange logic (repository and service setup) slightly hurts maintainability and could be refactored into helpers or test setup methods.",
    "The last test uses null! and Cast<DepartmentEntity>().ToList(), which introduces a bit of cognitive overhead and slightly reduces clarity.",
    "Hard-coded literals (e.g., ID 5, 1, 2) are acceptable here but could be named constants to further clarify intent in larger suites."
