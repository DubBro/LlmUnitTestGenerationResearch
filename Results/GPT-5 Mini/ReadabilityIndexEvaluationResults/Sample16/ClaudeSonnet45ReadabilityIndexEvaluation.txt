		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names clearly follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"Proper use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests",
		"Consistent AAA pattern implementation with clear comment separators in all tests",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout (input, replacement, result, expected)",
		"Good use of inline comments to explain non-obvious test data (e.g., Unicode characters, combining marks)",
		"No unnecessary nested classes or code duplication",
		"Proper adherence to C# and .NET naming conventions",
		"Well-structured and logically organized tests grouped by functionality",
		"Minor point: empty '// Arrange' sections in some parameterized tests could be omitted, but this is not a significant issue"
