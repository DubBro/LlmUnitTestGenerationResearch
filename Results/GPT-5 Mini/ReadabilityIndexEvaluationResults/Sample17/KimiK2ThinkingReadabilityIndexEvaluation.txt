		"Most test names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern clearly and consistently.",
		"Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention.",
		"Consistent application of AAA pattern with comments and proper separation in almost all tests.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple inputs.",
		"ToDiagonalMatrix_WhenCalled_ReturnsSquareMatrixWithDiagonalTest contains complex nested loop logic with conditional assertions, making it harder to read and maintain.",
		"Copy_WhenCalled_ReturnsNewArrayWithSameElements modifies the original array during the Assert phase, which is slightly counterintuitive.",
		"Variable names are clear, meaningful, and reflect their purpose throughout the tests.",
		"No unnecessary comments; only standard AAA block separators are used.",
		"Exception tests combine Act & Assert blocks appropriately, which is acceptable for this pattern.",
		"Overall code formatting and indentation are consistent, contributing to maintainability."
