    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (VectorExtensionsTests).",
    "Test method names consistently follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are descriptive (e.g., Dot_DifferentLengths_ThrowsArgumentException).",
    "AAA pattern is clearly followed in almost all tests with explicit // Arrange, // Act, // Assert sections and good spacing.",
    "Consistent use of xUnit attributes: [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory]/[InlineData] for the parameterized Scale test.",
    "Variable names (lhs, rhs, original, copy, vector, matrix, column, row) are short but meaningful in the mathematical context, aiding quick understanding.",
    "No unnecessary nested classes or unrelated comments; tests are flat, focused, and free of noise.",
    "Assertions are straightforward and local to each test, with no complex setup or indirection, improving traceability of failures.",
    "Use of loops and conditionals in ToDiagonalMatrix test is slightly more complex than necessary, adding some mental overhead compared to other tests.",
    "Minor inconsistency in comments for combined Act & Assert (Act & Assert vs separate blocks) slightly breaks visual uniformity.",
    "Overall formatting, spacing, and adherence to C# conventions are clean and consistent, making the file easy to scan and maintain."
