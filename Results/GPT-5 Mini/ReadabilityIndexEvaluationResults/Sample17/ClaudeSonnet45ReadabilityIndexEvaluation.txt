		"Test class name follows the correct pattern: VectorExtensionsTests",
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comments and blank line separation",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (e.g., 'original', 'copy', 'lhs', 'rhs', 'result')",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators, keeping code clean",
		"Standard C# and .NET naming conventions are followed throughout",
		"Good test coverage variety including edge cases (empty arrays, different lengths)",
		"Consistent formatting and structure across all test methods",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: Act & Assert combined in exception tests could use separate comments, but this is a very minor issue"
