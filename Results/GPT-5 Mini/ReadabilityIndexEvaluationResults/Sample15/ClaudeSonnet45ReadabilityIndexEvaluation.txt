		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern (Base64HelpersTests)",
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly applied with comment separators in all tests",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for similar scenarios",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (input, expected, result, original, base64)",
		"Tests are well-structured and easy to understand at a glance",
		"Proper separation of logical blocks with empty lines enhances readability",
		"One minor inconsistency: Decode_InvalidBase64_ThrowsFormatException uses static method call (Base64Helpers.Decode) instead of extension method pattern used elsewhere",
		"Empty Arrange blocks could be removed entirely to reduce visual clutter, though this is a minor point"
