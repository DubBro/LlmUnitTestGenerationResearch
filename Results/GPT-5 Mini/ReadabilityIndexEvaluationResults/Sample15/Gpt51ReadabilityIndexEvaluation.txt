  "readabilityIndex": 94,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `Base64HelpersTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern and reflects its purpose.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` convention and are self-explanatory.",
    "AAA pattern is clearly followed in all tests, with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, and `// Assert` comments and visual separation.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple input variations avoids duplication and makes scenarios easy to scan.",
    "Assertions are simple and direct, with minimal logic inside the tests, which aids readability and maintainability.",
    "Consistent use of UTF8 and `Convert.ToBase64String` in tests makes intent explicit for Unicode-related scenarios.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested classes; the file is focused and free of noise.",
    "Code formatting (spacing, line breaks, and indentation) is clean and consistent with common C# conventions.",
    "Combination of `Act & Assert` in the exception test is idiomatic for xUnit and still clearly readable.",
    "Minor inconsistency where most tests use extension methods (`input.Encode()` / `.Decode()`) but the last uses `Base64Helpers.Decode(...)`, slightly reducing uniformity."
