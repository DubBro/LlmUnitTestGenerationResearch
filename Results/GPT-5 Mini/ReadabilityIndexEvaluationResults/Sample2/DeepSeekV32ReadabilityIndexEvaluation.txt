		"Test class and method names follow the recommended naming patterns (EmployeeServiceTests, MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult).",
		"Tests consistently follow the AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert blocks separated by comments and empty lines.",
		"Helper methods (CreateEntity, CreateValidModel) reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.",
		"Proper use of asynchronous test signatures (async Task).",
		"Good use of mocking (NSubstitute) to isolate dependencies.",
		"Assertions are detailed and relevant to each test's purpose.",
		"All tests are single scenarios using [Fact]; no unnecessary [Theory] use.",
		"Code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and spacing.",
		"Minor issue: Some tests could use more descriptive variable names (e.g., 'n', 'c', 't' in filter tests) to improve clarity.",
		"Potential duplication in property-by-property assertions (GetAsync test) could be streamlined with a helper or object comparison, but remains readable."
