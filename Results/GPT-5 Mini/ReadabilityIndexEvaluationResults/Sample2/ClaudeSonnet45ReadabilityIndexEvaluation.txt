		"Test class name follows the 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern correctly",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comments and spacing in all tests",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"Helper methods (CreateEntity, CreateValidModel) reduce code duplication and improve maintainability",
		"Use of [Fact] attribute is appropriate for single scenarios, though [Theory] could be considered for some validation tests",
		"One test name is overly verbose: 'AddAsync_WhiteSpaceFirstName_ThrowsArgumentExceptionWithParamNameFirstName' could be simplified",
		"Assertions are clear and well-structured, though some tests have repetitive field-by-field assertions that could be refactored",
		"Naming conventions for variables and fields are consistent and follow C# standards",
		"Minor improvement opportunity: some magic numbers and strings could be extracted to constants for better maintainability"
