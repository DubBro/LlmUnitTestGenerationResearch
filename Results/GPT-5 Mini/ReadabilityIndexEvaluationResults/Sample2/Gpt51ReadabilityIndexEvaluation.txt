  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention (EmployeeServiceTests), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Individual test names are descriptive and follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent easy to understand.",
    "All async tests correctly use async Task signatures, and xUnit attributes ([Fact]) are used appropriately for single-scenario tests.",
    "AAA structure is consistently followed and visually separated with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert, which improves scanning and comprehension.",
    "Common Arrange data is extracted into helper methods (CreateEntity, CreateValidModel), reducing duplication and clarifying the setup.",
    "Assertions are explicit and straightforward; property-by-property checks in mapping tests make the expected behavior clear despite some verbosity.",
    "Use of NSubstitute is consistent and readable, with clear verification of calls and arguments (e.g., Arg.Is predicates).",
    "Overall formatting, indentation, and naming follow standard C# conventions, aiding readability and maintainability.",
    "A few extra comments beyond AAA markers (e.g., // Arrange helpers, // Assert: production code incorrectly uses ...) slightly deviate from the no-comments guideline but do not significantly harm clarity.",
    "Some tests are somewhat long or contain complex predicates (e.g., large Arg.Is expressions), which slightly reduces immediacy of understanding but remains acceptable."
