	"reasons": [
		"Consistent AAA pattern implementation with clear separation and comments in all tests",
		"Clear and descriptive naming for test class and all test methods following the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern",
		"Effective use of private static helper methods (CreateEntity, CreateValidModel) to reduce code duplication",
		"Proper asynchronous test signatures using async Task instead of async void",
		"Excessive verbosity in property mapping assertions (14 individual Assert.Equal calls) reduces conciseness",
		"Use of non-descriptive magic strings and values ('n', 'c', 't', 1m, 2m, 3, 4) in filter tests without named constants",
		"Deviation from 'no comments' guideline with a production code behavior explanation in one test",
		"Clear and meaningful variable naming throughout (repo, service, model, result, ex)",
		"Each test maintains good isolation by creating its own mocks and service instances",
		"Appropriate use of NSubstitute assertions (Received, DidNotReceive, Arg.Is) for verification"
