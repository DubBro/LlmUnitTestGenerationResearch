    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_Result conventions, making intent easy to understand.",
    "All async tests correctly return Task and use xUnit’s [Fact] and [Theory] attributes appropriately for single- and multi-case scenarios.",
    "Consistent AAA pattern is followed with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments, and logical separation of blocks aids quick comprehension.",
    "Variable and field names (imei, repo, service, entity, walkEntities) are meaningful and reflect their roles, improving readability.",
    "Layout and formatting are clean and consistent (brace style, spacing, ordering), with no nesting or structural complexity in the test class.",
    "Mocking and interaction verification via NSubstitute are straightforward and consistently used, clearly expressing dependencies and expectations.",
    "Minor issues include some repetitive setup (repo, service) and a few non-AAA comments in InlineData, plus slightly verbose assertion blocks, but these do not significantly hinder readability."
