{
	"readabilityIndex": 78,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently, making test intent clear",
		"All async tests correctly use 'async Task' signature instead of 'async void'",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied with comment markers and empty line separation, enhancing structure clarity",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication for testing multiple invalid IMEI formats",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names throughout (e.g., 'walkEntities', 'invalidImei', 'repo')",
		"Minor readability issue: verbose assertion pattern in first test (Assert.IsType with immediate new List construction is redundant)",
		"Consistent verification of repository interactions using NSubstitute's Received() pattern enhances test completeness visibility",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA markers, keeping code clean and focused",
		"Standard C# and .NET naming conventions are followed throughout the test suite"
