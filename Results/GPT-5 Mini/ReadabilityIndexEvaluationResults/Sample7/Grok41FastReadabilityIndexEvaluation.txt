		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern perfectly.",
		"Test method names adhere closely to MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for variations, reducing duplication.",
		"Consistent AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and clear separation.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable and object names reflecting purpose.",
		"Standard C# naming conventions and async Task signatures.",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
		"Minor flaw: awkward list casting in first test's Assert (new List<WalkDTO>(result)).",
		"Slight deviation: Act & Assert combined in exception tests.",
		"Repetitive individual Asserts for list items could be more concise."
