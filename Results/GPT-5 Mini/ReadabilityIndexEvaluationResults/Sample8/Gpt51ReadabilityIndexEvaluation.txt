  "readabilityIndex": 89,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `LuTests` clearly maps to the SUT `Lu` and follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern.",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern, making intent clear.",
    "AAA structure is consistently used and visually separated with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments, improving scanability.",
    "Naming of local variables (`source`, `matrix`, `coefficients`, `zeroMatrix`, etc.) is clear and domain-appropriate.",
    "Code formatting, indentation, and brace style are consistent and standard, aiding quick reading.",
    "Helper method `MultiplyMatrices` extracts repetitive logic into a clearly named function, reducing duplication in assertions.",
    "Tests avoid unnecessary nesting or complex setup, keeping each scenario relatively short and focused.",
    "A couple of inline explanatory comments (e.g., expected solution) add slight noise beyond pure AAA comments, but impact is minor.",
    "The helper method contains non-trivial logic and validation, which adds some cognitive load inside the test class, slightly reducing simplicity.",
    "Some scenarios (e.g., small matrix variations) could be expressed as theories with `[InlineData]`, but the current duplication is limited and not severely harmful."
