		"Test class name 'LuTests' is not descriptive enough; consider a more explicit name like 'LuDecompositionTests'.",
		"Non-AAA comments found in several tests (e.g., // expected solution...), violating the guideline that only Arrange/Act/Assert comments should be present.",
		"Some tests combine Act and Assert phases under a single comment, deviating from the strict AAA pattern.",
		"Repeated instantiation of the Lu class in each test adds duplication and could be moved to a fixture.",
		"No use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for similar scenarios, leading to code duplication across tests.",
		"Test method names are overly verbose, making them harder to read at a glance.",
		"The tolerance parameter (10) in double assertions is not explained, potentially confusing readers.",
		"Helper method MultiplyMatrices is embedded in the test class, mixing test logic with utility code.",
		"The assertion in 'Eliminate_SingularMatrix_ReturnsNaNValues' uses a logical OR, reducing clarity."
