{
	"readabilityIndex": 78,
	"reasons": [
		"Test method names follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern consistently, making it easy to understand what each test validates",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with proper comment markers (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and visual separation between blocks",
		"Good use of [Fact] attributes for individual test scenarios, appropriate for the test cases presented",
		"Variable names are descriptive and meaningful (source, matrix, coefficients, solution, nonSquare, etc.)",
		"Helper method MultiplyMatrices is appropriately placed and well-structured for test support",
		"Some test names could be more precise: 'Decompose_SquareMatrix_ReturnsLowerAndUpperWhichMultiplyToSource' is verbose and could be 'Decompose_SquareMatrix_ReturnsCorrectLUDecomposition'",
		"Minor inconsistency: 'Decompose_NonSquare_ThrowsArgumentException' uses 'Act & Assert' comment instead of separating them, though this pattern is acceptable for exception tests",
		"The test for NaN/Infinity values uses OR condition which makes the assertion less precise, though understandable given the nature of singular matrix operations",
		"Overall structure is clean with no unnecessary nesting, proper formatting, and consistent coding style throughout"
