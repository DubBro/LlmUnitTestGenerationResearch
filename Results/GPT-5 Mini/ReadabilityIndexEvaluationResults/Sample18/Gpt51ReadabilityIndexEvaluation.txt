  "readabilityIndex": 94,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `CaesarEncoderTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention and matches the SUT.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and clearly describe intent (e.g., `Encode_PreservesNonLetterCharacters_ReturnsExpected`).",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for input variations is appropriate and avoids duplication, while `[Fact]` is used correctly for single scenarios.",
    "AAA pattern is followed in all tests with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` separators, making the flow easy to follow.",
    "Variable names like `input`, `key`, `expected`, `actual`, `encoded`, and `decoded` are meaningful and consistent across tests.",
    "Formatting is clean and consistent: proper spacing, indentation, and no unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
    "Tests are short, focused, and each scenario is clearly isolated, which aids quick understanding and maintenance.",
    "The decode behavior is tested via a clearly named test `Decode_WhenApplied_AfterEncode_ReturnsOriginal`, making the relationship between encode and decode explicit.",
    "The null and empty string edge cases are covered with well-named tests, improving clarity of boundary behavior.",
    "Minor deviation from strict AAA in the null test (`Act & Assert` combined) is acceptable but prevents it from being absolutely ideal."
