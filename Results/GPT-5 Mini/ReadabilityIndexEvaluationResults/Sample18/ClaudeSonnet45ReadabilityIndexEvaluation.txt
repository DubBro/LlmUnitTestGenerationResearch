		"Test class name follows the recommended pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Most test names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern with clear descriptions",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] and [Theory] attributes to avoid code duplication",
		"AAA pattern is consistently followed with comment markers and empty line separators",
		"Naming conventions for variables are clear and meaningful (input, key, expected, actual)",
		"One test combines Act and Assert blocks ('Encode_Null_ThrowsNullReferenceException'), slightly deviating from strict AAA separation",
		"Empty Arrange blocks in some tests could be removed or contain a clarifying comment about no setup being needed",
		"Test name 'Decode_WhenApplied_AfterEncode_ReturnsOriginal' is slightly verbose but still understandable",
		"Overall structure is clean, logical, and easy to maintain with minimal formatting issues"
