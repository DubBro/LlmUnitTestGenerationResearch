	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"All tests follow the AAA pattern with clear comment separators (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert)",
		"Variable and method names are clear and meaningful throughout the tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] attribute for individual test scenarios",
		"Tests are well-structured with proper empty line separation between AAA blocks",
		"Minor issue: Comment in line 40 ('// ensure input array not modified') violates the rule of only using AAA comments",
		"Minor issue: No [Theory] with [InlineData] used where it could reduce duplication (e.g., for GetOptimalParentheses tests with different inputs)",
		"Code adheres to standard C# and .NET naming conventions",
		"Overall very readable and maintainable with only minor deviations from the ideal"
