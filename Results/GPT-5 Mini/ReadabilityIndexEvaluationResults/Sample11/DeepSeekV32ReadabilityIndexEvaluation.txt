		"Test class name follows the 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern (MatrixChainMultiplicationTests).",
		"Test method names follow 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, clearly describing scenarios.",
		"All tests follow AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert blocks separated by comments and empty lines.",
		"Good use of xUnit's [Fact] for single scenario tests.",
		"Variables have clear, meaningful names (p, n, s, cost, parentheses).",
		"Each test focuses on a single scenario and is appropriately sized.",
		"Assertions are clear and easy to understand with meaningful expected values.",
		"Comments in test code are limited to AAA block separators only.",
		"Tests use appropriate xUnit assertion methods (Assert.Equal, Assert.NotNull, Assert.Throws).",
		"Minor issue: test for custom s matrix could benefit from more descriptive variable naming or a comment explaining the matrix structure."
