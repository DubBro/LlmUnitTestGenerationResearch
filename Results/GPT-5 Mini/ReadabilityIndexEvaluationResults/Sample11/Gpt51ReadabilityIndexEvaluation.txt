  "readabilityIndex": 86,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern (MatrixChainMultiplicationTests), clearly indicating the subject under test.",
    "Test method names mostly follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern and are descriptive, making the intent of each test easy to understand.",
    "AAA structure is consistently present and explicitly separated with Arrange/Act/Assert comments, which improves readability and navigation within tests.",
    "Formatting and spacing are clean and consistent, with good use of blank lines between logical sections, enhancing visual clarity.",
    "Each test focuses on a single scenario and has a small, manageable body, which makes them easy to scan and maintain.",
    "Use of xUnit attributes is appropriate ([Fact] for single scenarios), avoiding unnecessary complexity or parameterization.",
    "Some variable names (p, n, s) are terse and algorithmic rather than descriptive, slightly reducing self-documentation of the tests.",
    "There are inline comments beyond Arrange/Act/Assert (e.g., explaining indices and desired parentheses), which, while helpful, add a bit of noise and are a minor deviation from the described ideal.",
    "Magic numbers are used directly in several assertions without named constants, which slightly reduces expressiveness and makes changes to expected values a bit harder to manage."
