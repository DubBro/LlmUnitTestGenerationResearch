  "reasons": [
    "Test class and method names are clear, descriptive, and follow the ClassUnderTestTests and Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult patterns, which makes intent easy to grasp.",
    "Use of [Fact] and [Theory] with [InlineData] is appropriate and avoids duplication for permutation matrix scenarios.",
    "AAA structure is mostly followed and explicitly marked with comments, improving visual separation of Arrange, Act, and Assert phases.",
    "Variable names (original, matrixToDecompose, L, U, P, permutation, expected) are meaningful and closely aligned with the mathematical domain.",
    "Formatting and indentation are consistent; spacing and blank lines help segment logical parts of the tests.",
    "The long Decompose_KnownMatrix_ReconstructsPermutedOriginal test combines multiple responsibilities and deep nested loops, which slightly hurts readability and could be split or moved to helper assertions.",
    "Helper method MultiplyMatrices is readable but uses nested loops without braces on all levels, which reduces clarity and maintainability compared to fully braced blocks."
