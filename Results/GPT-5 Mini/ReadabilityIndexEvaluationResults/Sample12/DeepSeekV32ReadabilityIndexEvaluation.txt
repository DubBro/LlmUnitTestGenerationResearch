{"readabilityIndex": 84, "reasons": ["Test class follows clear naming convention 'LUPDecompositionTests' matching the class under test.", "Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, making test intentions clear.", "Tests use proper AAA pattern with explicit comments for Arrange, Act, Assert blocks.", "Proper use of [Fact] and [Theory] attributes with [InlineData] to avoid duplication.", "Good use of helper method 'MultiplyMatrices' to reduce code duplication.", "Clear, meaningful variable names like 'singular', 'matrix', 'original', 'L', 'U', 'P'.", "Tests include appropriate assertions with tolerance for floating-point comparisons.", "Only necessary comments (AAA separators) are present, no extraneous comments.", "One minor readability issue: nested loops in assertions could be extracted to named helper methods for better readability."]}
