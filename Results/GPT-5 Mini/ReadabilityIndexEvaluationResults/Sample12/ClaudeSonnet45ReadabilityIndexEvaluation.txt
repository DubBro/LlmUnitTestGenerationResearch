		"Test class follows the naming convention 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern correctly",
		"All test methods follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' naming pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is clearly implemented with comments and proper spacing in all tests",
		"Good use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication in GetPermutationMatrix tests",
		"Meaningful variable names throughout (singular, original, matrixToDecompose, etc.)",
		"Helper method MultiplyMatrices is well-named and logically placed at the bottom of the class",
		"Inline comments within the Assert section of Decompose_KnownMatrix_ReconstructsPermutedOriginal test violate the principle of having only AAA comments",
		"The test Decompose_OneByOneMatrix_ReturnsExpectedLAndUAndP could have assertions grouped more clearly to improve flow",
		"Overall structure is clean with no unnecessary nested classes and proper adherence to C# conventions",
		"Minor inconsistency: GetPermutationMatrix_ReturnsExpectedString test has 'Arrange & Act' combined in a single comment, deviating slightly from strict AAA separation"
