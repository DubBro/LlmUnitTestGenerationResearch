		"Test class name follows the recommended 'ClassUnderTestTests' pattern",
		"Test method names consistently follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern, making intentions clear",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests, avoiding code duplication",
		"AAA pattern is clearly followed with comment markers (// Arrange, // Act, // Assert) and proper spacing",
		"Variable names are clear and descriptive (input, result, expected)",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes, keeping the structure clean",
		"Standard C# and .NET naming conventions are followed throughout",
		"One minor inconsistency: GetFileExtension_NullOrWhitespace_ReturnsSame tests two scenarios in one test method, slightly deviating from single-responsibility principle",
		"Overall excellent readability with consistent formatting and logical test organization"
