  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `StringExtensionsTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` pattern.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and are very descriptive.",
    "AAA pattern is used in all tests with clear `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments and spacing, improving structure and scanability.",
    "Appropriate use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for multiple input variations, avoiding duplication and keeping tests compact.",
    "Code style and formatting are consistent, with standard C# naming conventions and no distracting or unnecessary comments.",
    "Each test body is short and focused, making the intent and assertions easy to understand at a glance.",
    "Minor drawback: a small number of tests (e.g., `GetFileExtension_NullOrWhitespace_ReturnsSame`) cover multiple logical cases in a single test, slightly reducing failure localization and per-scenario clarity."
