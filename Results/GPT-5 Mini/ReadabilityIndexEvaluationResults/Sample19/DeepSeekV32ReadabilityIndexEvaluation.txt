		"Clean separation between different test methods with logical grouping",
		"Consistent formatting and adherence to C# naming conventions",

		"No unnecessary nested classes or complex test structures",
		"Tests focus on single scenarios with clear expectations",
		"Minimal Arrange sections when not needed, keeping tests concise",
		"Only minor improvement: Could combine some similar ToCsvCompatible test scenarios into parameterized theories"
