	"reasons": [
		"Extraneous inline comments explaining logic violate the 'no comments other than AAA' rule.",
		"Exception tests combine Act and Assert blocks, deviating from pure AAA pattern.",
		"Significant code duplication in Arrange sections across multiple tests.",
		"Opportunity to use [Theory] with [InlineData] is missed for parameterized scenarios.",
		"Test names are overly verbose, reducing readability despite following the pattern.",
		"Expected value calculations mixed directly into Arrange block could be encapsulated.",
		"Use of Assert.False with string.IsNullOrEmpty is less idiomatic than Assert.NotEmpty.",
		"Verbose string splitting logic for counting tokens could be simplified.",
		"Lack of shared setup helper methods leads to repetitive boilerplate code.",
		"Inline comments on same lines reduce visual separation and clarity."
