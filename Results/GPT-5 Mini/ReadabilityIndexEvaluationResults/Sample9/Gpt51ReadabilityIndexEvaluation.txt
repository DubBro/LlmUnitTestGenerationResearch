  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent very clear, albeit a bit long.",
    "AAA structure is consistently used and clearly separated with comments, improving logical flow and scanability.",
    "Variable names in Arrange blocks are meaningful and consistent (minWords, maxWords, etc.), aiding quick understanding of inputs.",
    "Assertions are straightforward, focused, and read almost like documentation of expected behavior.",
    "No unnecessary nesting or complex setup logic; each test is self-contained and easy to follow.",
    "Use of [Fact] for single scenarios is appropriate, but several tests could be consolidated via [Theory] and [InlineData] to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
    "Significant duplication in Arrange sections between similar tests slightly hurts maintainability and increases future change effort.",
    "Inline explanatory comments about Random.Next behavior add some noise and couple tests to internal implementation details, slightly reducing clarity.",
    "String-splitting logic for counts is readable but somewhat verbose; minor extraction or helper methods could further improve clarity."
