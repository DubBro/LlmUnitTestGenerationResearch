    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the subject under test (OntologyHelperTests).",
    "Test method names follow the Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult style and are descriptive, making each scenario easy to understand.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently applied with clear // Arrange, // Act, and // Assert comments and blank-line separation, improving visual structure.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for the common ‘other node types’ scenario reduces duplication and improves maintainability.",
    "Naming of variables (e.g., node, result) is clear and consistent, and the use of NSubstitute is straightforward and readable.",
    "Exception scenarios are clearly expressed using Assert.Throws with concise, readable lambda expressions.",
    "No extraneous comments or dead code; tests are short, focused, and each covers one behavior.",
    "Code style adheres to standard C#/.NET conventions, including casing, spacing, and attribute placement.",
    "Minor duplication in Arrange steps across several tests could be refactored (e.g., helper methods or data-driven tests) but does not significantly hurt readability."
