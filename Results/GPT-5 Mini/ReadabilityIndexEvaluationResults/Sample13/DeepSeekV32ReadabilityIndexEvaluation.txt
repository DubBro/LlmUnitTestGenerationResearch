{"readabilityIndex": 89, "reasons": ["Test class and method names are clear, meaningful, and follow the recommended naming conventions.", "Tests consistently follow the AAA pattern with clear Arrange-Act-Assert blocks and separation.", "Uses `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` appropriately to avoid duplication for similar scenarios.", "Well-structured code with good formatting and consistent indentation.", "Violation: test method signatures use `async void` instead of `async Task`? (Actually, the methods are synchronous, so this is not applicable; however, the test for async scenario is not present.)", "Minor violation: there's a minor redundancy in the 'OtherNodeTypes' test where node.ToString() is set but not used in the assertion; this slightly affects readability but is not critical.", "All scenarios are logically grouped and easy to understand, covering edge cases effectively.", "Comments are used correctly as AAA block separators.", "The test suite demonstrates good maintainability and logical flow."]}
