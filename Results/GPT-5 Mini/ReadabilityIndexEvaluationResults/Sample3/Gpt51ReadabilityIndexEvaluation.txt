  "readabilityIndex": 86,
  "reasons": [
    "Test class name `NoteServiceTests` clearly follows the `ClassUnderTestTests` convention.",
    "Test method names consistently follow the `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern and convey intent well.",
    "All async tests correctly use `async Task` signatures, matching best practices.",
    "AAA structure is followed in every test and is explicitly separated by `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (or `// Act & Assert`) comments.",
    "Variable and mock names (`unitOfWork`, `notesRepo`, `transaction`, `model`, `entity`) are descriptive and consistent, aiding quick understanding.",
    "Use of `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for `AddAsync_InvalidUserId_ThrowsUserNotFoundException` reduces duplication and clarifies parameterized scenarios.",
    "There is significant repetition of Arrange boilerplate for creating `unitOfWork`, repositories, and transactions, which adds noise and slightly hurts maintainability; shared setup or helper methods could improve this.",
    "Some tests (especially transaction-related ones and the first `GetAllByUserIdAsync` test) are relatively long and dense with NSubstitute configuration and many assertions, which slightly reduces readability despite still being understandable."
