		"Test class name follows the pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests' (NoteServiceTests).",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently.",
		"Tests follow the AAA pattern with clear 'Arrange', 'Act', and 'Assert' comments and logical separation.",
		"Asynchronous tests are correctly declared with 'async Task'.",
		"Good use of xUnit attributes: [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests (AddAsync_InvalidUserId_ThrowsUserNotFoundException).",
		"Clear and meaningful variable names (e.g., unitOfWork, notesRepo, capturedEntity).",
		"Tests are structured logically with consistent formatting and indentation.",
		"Only minimal comments (AAA separators) are present, enhancing readability.",
		"Arrange sections are appropriately sized, but some setup code duplication exists across tests (mocking repositories) that slightly affects maintainability.",
		"Assert sections are precise and focused on verifying the expected behavior."
