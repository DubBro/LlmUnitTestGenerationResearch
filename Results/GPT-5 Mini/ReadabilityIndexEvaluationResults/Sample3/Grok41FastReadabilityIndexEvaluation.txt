		"Test class name follows ClassUnderTestTests pattern.",
		"Test method names mostly follow MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern.",
		"All async tests correctly use async Task signatures.",
		"Consistent use of AAA pattern with // Arrange, // Act, // Assert comments and clear separation.",
		"Appropriate use of [Fact] and [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid duplication in parameterized tests.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable and mock names reflecting purpose.",
		"No unnecessary comments or nested classes.",
		"Adheres to C# naming conventions and good formatting.",
		"Repetitive mock setup (unitOfWork, notesRepo) in every test reduces maintainability.",
		"Some tests combine // Act & Assert for exceptions, slightly deviating from strict AAA.",
		"Verbose assertions in places (e.g., multiple Assert.Contains) could be more concise."
