		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear comments separating Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks",
		"Test method signatures correctly use 'async Task' for asynchronous tests",
		"Variable names are clear and meaningful (repository, mapper, entity, model, result)",
		"Test names are descriptive and explain the scenario being tested, though they don't strictly follow 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern",
		"No unnecessary comments outside of AAA block separators",
		"Code adheres to standard C# naming conventions",
		"Could benefit from using [Theory] with [InlineData] to reduce duplication between the first two tests which test similar scenarios with different IDs",
		"Test structure is consistent across all three test methods making them easy to read and maintain",
		"Empty lines properly separate AAA blocks improving visual clarity"
