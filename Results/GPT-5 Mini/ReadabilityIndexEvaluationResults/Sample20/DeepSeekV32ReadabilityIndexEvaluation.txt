{"readabilityIndex": 85, "reasons": ["Test class name 'FisherYatesShufflerTests' correctly follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern.", "Test method names clearly follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern (e.g., Shuffle_NullArray_ThrowsNullReferenceException, Shuffle_EmptyArray_RemainsUnchanged).", "All tests properly follow the AAA pattern with clear Arrange, Act, Assert sections marked with comments.", "Good use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for multiple input variations (Shuffle_WithoutSeed_PreservesElements).", "Code structure is clean with proper separation and no unnecessary nested classes.", "Helper method AssertSameMultiset has a clear name and purpose, though it could be marked private static to better reflect its scope (already is).", "Variable and parameter names are meaningful and reflect their purpose (e.g., original, array, shuffler, seed).", "Minor: The helper method AssertSameMultiset includes assertion logic which is acceptable but could be extracted to a separate test utility if reused elsewhere.", "All tests are synchronous and properly return void (no async methods needed).", "The code adheres to standard C# and .NET naming conventions and formatting."]}
