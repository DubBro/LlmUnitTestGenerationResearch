  "reasons": [
    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests pattern and clearly indicates the unit under test (FisherYatesShufflerTests).",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent immediately clear.",
    "Consistent use of [Fact] for single scenarios and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized scenarios avoids duplication and improves structure.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently followed, with clear separation of Arrange, Act, and Assert blocks using comments and spacing.",
    "Helper method AssertSameMultiset is well-named, generic, and encapsulates repeated logic, improving readability and maintainability.",
    "Variable names (e.g., original, array, seed, expected) are meaningful and make the flow of each test easy to follow.",
    "Code formatting and layout are clean and consistent, with appropriate use of whitespace and no deeply nested structures.",
    "All tests are synchronous void-returning methods decorated with xUnit attributes correctly, following xUnit conventions (no async void misuse).",
    "Single responsibility per test: each test focuses on one behavior or scenario, making failures easy to diagnose.",
    "Minor deviation from the guideline about comments (extra non-AAA comments inside tests and on the helper) slightly reduces ideal cleanliness but does not significantly harm readability."
