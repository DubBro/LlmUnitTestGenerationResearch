	"readabilityIndex": 72,
	"reasons": [
		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Most test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern clearly",
		"AAA pattern is consistently applied and marked with comments in all tests",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] to avoid code duplication in parameterized tests",
		"Helper method 'AssertSameMultiset' is well-named and useful, but comment '// Arrange helper' is misleading (it's an assertion helper, not arrange)",
		"Good use of meaningful variable names throughout the tests",
		"Code adheres to standard C# and .NET naming conventions",
		"Minor issue: 'Shuffle_WithSeed_IsDeterministicAcrossInstances' test name could be clearer about expected result",
		"Minor structural concern: helper method placement at top is unconventional; typically placed at bottom of test class",
		"Overall structure is clean with consistent formatting and good separation of concerns"
