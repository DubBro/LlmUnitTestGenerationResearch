		"Test class name follows the correct pattern 'ClassUnderTestTests'",
		"Test method names follow the 'MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult' pattern consistently",
		"AAA pattern is properly implemented with comment separators and empty lines between blocks",
		"Appropriate use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for testing multiple invalid inputs, avoiding duplication",
		"Variable and parameter names are clear and meaningful (count, result, expected)",
		"Code adheres to standard C# and .NET naming conventions",
		"No unnecessary comments beyond AAA separators",
		"Minor code duplication in assertion logic for comparing 2D arrays across two tests (GetRhombus_CountIs3 and GetRhombus_CountIs5)",
		"The duplicate nested loops for array comparison could be extracted to a helper method to improve maintainability",
		"Overall structure is clear and tests are easy to understand"
