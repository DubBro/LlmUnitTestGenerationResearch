    "Test class name follows the ClassUnderTestTests convention and clearly indicates the subject under test.",
    "Test method names are descriptive and follow the MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult pattern, making intent easy to understand.",
    "AAA pattern is consistently used and visually separated with comments and blank lines, improving scanability.",
    "Use of [Theory] with [InlineData] for invalid inputs avoids duplication and groups similar scenarios logically.",
    "Assertions are straightforward, ordered logically (null-checks, dimension checks, then content checks), and easy to follow.",
    "Formatting is clean and consistent: indentation, spacing, and bracing style follow common C# conventions.",
    "Array initializers for expected patterns are well-structured and aligned, making visual comparison of patterns feasible.",
    "No unnecessary comments or nested classes; the file is focused and uncluttered.",
    "Some duplication exists in the 2D array comparison loops, which could be extracted to a helper method to reduce repetition and slightly improve maintainability.",
    "Exception assertion could be more specific (custom exception type) to improve clarity of expected behavior, though this is a minor readability concern."
