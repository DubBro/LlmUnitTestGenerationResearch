		"Appropriate use of [Theory] and [InlineData] for multiple invalid inputs, avoiding duplication.",
		"Class name follows ClassUnderTestTests convention.",
		"Clear, meaningful variable names and standard C# naming conventions.",
		"No unnecessary comments, nested classes, or complexity.",
		"Minor code duplication in dimension checks and nested loops across patterned tests (sizes 3 and 5).",
